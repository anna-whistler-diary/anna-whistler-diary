			<p class="Body-Text">Dr. James Rogers (1819 – 11 July 1890), physician to the British Legation in St.&#160;Petersburg, was also the Whistler family’s physician. Born in Scotland, he received his MD from Glasgow University in 1833 and went to Russia, where he was licensed by the Imperial Medical Chirurgical Academy of St.&#160;Petersburg in 1834. He engaged in private practice, but at some point became attached to the Obukhov Hospital in that city.<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-002-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-002">2</a></span></span> When the position of physician to the British Legation was relinquished by Sir George William Lefevre (1798–1846) in 1842, Rogers succeeded him.<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-003-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-003">3</a></span></span> We know, mainly from Anna Whistler’s St.&#160;Petersburg diaries, that he attended the grave illness of John Stevenson Maxwell (1844) and the death (October 1846) of the Whistlers’ last child, John Bouttatz Whistler. He was also the physician for Charlotte Leon, whom he supplied with free medications and attended at her final illness (1847). He attended Major Whistler (see <a href="images_1.html#image7" target="_blank">Images 7–8, <a href="images_1.html#image21" target="_blank">21</a>) in his final illness and was present on the night of 7 April 1849, when Major Whistler died. He also attended baby George Whistler Eastwick in his final illness (1849) and was considered by the child’s parents to be “very attentive and appears to study his case more than Dr. C [Collier, their own physician at Alexandrofsky] did.”<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-004-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-004">4</a></span></span> He lived at 247 Galernaia Street in the building belonging to Potocki, in the First Admiralty District, Fourth Ward (see “Maps”).<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-005-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-005">5</a></span></span></p>
			<p class="Body-Text">It is not clear exactly when he returned to England permanently, but he settled in Port View, Saltash, Cornwall,<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-006-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-006">6</a></span></span> where his brother, Dr. William Rogers (1817 – 7 April 1904), Surgeon RN (retired as of early 1863), was living with his wife and children.<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-007-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-007">7</a></span></span> It appears that James Rogers registered for practice there in 1873 and retired in 1877.<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-008-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-008">8</a></span></span> He was the author of <span class="CharOverride-1">On the Present State of Therapeutics, with Some Suggestions for Placing It upon a More Scientific Basis</span> (London and Edinburgh: John Churchill &amp; Sons, 1870).<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-009-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-009">9</a></span></span> </p>

(12), Emily Chalmers (10), and Dora (9). By the 1881 Census, Dora (19) unmarried, was living with her Uncle James. By 1890, she had gone back to her father’s home and Emily C. Rogers, her sister, was living with Uncle James.<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-012-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-012">12</a></span></span> Florence Rogers (Edinburgh 1857 – Exeter, Devon 11 October 1922) had married at Stoke Damerel in July 1886 Cecil Clement Longridge (Tynemouth 6 September 1852 – Naples, Italy 23 November 1939), bachelor, of St. Bede’s College, Manchester.<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-013-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-013">13</a></span></span></p>

He left money to the Royal National Life Boat Institution for the purchase of a lifeboat, named, for his nephew, the “Willie Rogers,”<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-015-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-015">15</a></span></span> and to the East End Juvenile Mission (Dr. Barnardo’s Homes). He left an annual lifetime trust of £450 for his brother. The most interesting bequest, however, was that to his nieces, to whom he left an extensive collection of works of art. Of some thirty-five oil paintings, engravings, oleographs, and a watercolor, three are of chief interest in the context of Anna Whistler’s diaries: a sea piece (untitled in the will) by the Russian marine painter, Ivan Konstantinovich<span class="CharOverride-1"> </span>Aivazovskii (1817–1901; see <a href="images_7.html#image178" target="_blank">Image 178</a>) and an oil portrait and a watercolor portrait of James Rogers.<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-016-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-016">16</a></span></span> The other artists and works represented in the bequest were: <span class="CharOverride-1">Upper Kaeruthen</span>,<span class="CharOverride-1"> Landscape near Berne</span>,<span class="CharOverride-1"> Scene near Gosau in Austria</span>, and<span class="CharOverride-1"> The Innthal Tyrol</span> by Pál Böhm (1839–1905);<span class="CharOverride-1"> Bavarian Mountain</span> by either Jakob Gauermann (1773–1843) or Friedrich Gauermann (1807–1862); <span class="CharOverride-1">Chiemscee Bavaria</span> by George Mader (1824–1881);<span class="CharOverride-1"> Berchtesgaden</span> by Julius Lange (1817–1878); <span class="CharOverride-1">Winter Scene</span> and <span class="CharOverride-1">Deer in Winter </span>by<span class="CharOverride-1"> </span>Joseph Wolfram (b. 1860); <span class="CharOverride-1">The Inspruck in Tyrol</span> and<span class="CharOverride-1"> </span>(after Rosa Bonheur) <span class="CharOverride-1">Cattle and Morning in the Highlands</span> by Muller; <span class="CharOverride-1">Winter Scene in Russia</span> by Linder; <span class="CharOverride-1">Mount Dachstein</span> by Hermanstadter; <span class="CharOverride-1">A Winter Night</span> by Wager;<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-017-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-017">17</a></span></span> two paintings by Antonio Canaletto (1697–1768); two scenes in Holland by François Antoine Léon Fleury (1804–1858); works with no artist’s name supplied: the engravings <span class="CharOverride-1">Scottish Raid</span>,<span class="CharOverride-1"> Siege of Sebastopol</span>,<span class="CharOverride-1"> Relief of Lucknow</span>,<span class="CharOverride-1"> </span>and <span class="CharOverride-1">Covenanters</span>, and the painting <span class="CharOverride-1">The Lord’s Supper</span>; four oleographs; and family portraits.<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-018-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-018">18</a></span></span> The gross value of his personal estate amounted to some £24,000.<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-019-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-019">19</a></span></span></p>
			<p class="Body-Text">James Rogers died on 11 July 1890. Funeral services were held at St. Stephen’s Church, Saltash, on 14 July, and he was buried in St. Stephen’s Churchyard. His grave monument is a grey granite pillar, rectangular in cross-section, with the top “weathered” four ways and a plinth at the bottom. The inscription reads: “In memory of James Rogers, M.D., formerly physician to the British Legation and Abouchoff Hospital at St.&#160;Petersburg, died at Saltash, 11 July 1890, aged eighty years.”<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-020-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-020">20</a></span></span></p>
