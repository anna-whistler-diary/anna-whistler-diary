			<p class="Body-Text">Of the members of the Cruft and Fitch families who traveled to Europe, at least four of whom Anna Whistler (see <a href="images_1.html#image1" target="_blank">Images 1–5</a>) met, the two males have the fullest biographies. William Smith Cruft (Boston 17 February 1815 – Paris 16 July 1851) and James Jackson Cruft (Boston 20 December 1826 – Boston 25 August 1849) were the sons of Elizabeth Storer (Smith) and Edward Cruft, a well-known Boston shipping merchant.<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-001-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-001">1</a></span></span> William graduated from Harvard College in 1834, having “entered … very reluctantly,” “passed [his] time there very unpleasantly,” and left “very gladly,” because he really wanted to be a businessman.<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-002-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-002">2</a></span></span> After graduation, “he entered the counting-house of R.G. Shaw and Company,” where he worked until 1836.<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-003-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-003">3</a></span></span> At the end of 1836, he moved to New York and formed a co-partnership with Cleayton Newbold, “a New York merchant, under the firm name of Newbold and Cruft, as general commission merchants.”<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-004-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-004">4</a></span></span> Their firm, at 65 Broad Street, was destroyed by the great fire of 19 July 1845, and they moved to 47 South St. but were listed at the old address in 1846–47. From 1847–48 to 1852–53, although William Smith Cruft had died in 1851, the firm appears as Newbold and Cruft and was located at 4 Broadway. In 1854–55, the name of the firm appears as Newbold and DeGroot, William De Groot having been a partner since at least 1851.<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-005-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-005">5</a></span></span> </p>
			<p class="Body-Text">Harvard records show that William S. Cruft received an MA in 1837.<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-006-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-006">6</a></span></span> In that year, he “visited Europe to make his house known and establish correspondence.”<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-007-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-007">7</a></span></span> He returned to the United States in 1838, but because of failing health went again to Europe in 1841.<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-008-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-008">8</a></span></span> Recovered, he returned home and on 22 November 1842, married at Trinity Church in Norwich, Connecticut, Sophia Ingram Fitch (New Hartford, NY 10 December 1817 – no later than 1881), the daughter of Mary Ingram (Rogers) and Stephen Fitch.<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-009-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-009">9</a></span></span> </p>
			<p class="Body-Text">Stephen Fitch manufactured iron and farmed in Bozrah, Connecticut, until his marriage in 1817, at which time he settled in New Hartford, Oneida County, New York, until 1832. In that year, he moved to Norwich, Connecticut, and when his wife died in 1837, resettled in his birthplace of Bozrah. Here, together with his brother Asa, he manufactured cotton goods.<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-010-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-010">10</a></span></span> </p>
			<p class="Body-Text">In 1844, William S. Cruft’s health failed again, and he and his wife embarked on a two-year trip, first to the milder climate of Madeira and then to the Continent, including Russia, from late December 1844 until September 1846.<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-011-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-011">11</a></span></span> His condition did not improve, and on 19 April 1850, they again applied for passports.<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-012-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-012">12</a></span></span> William S. Cruft died in Paris on 16 July 1851 at “Meurice’s Hotel … after a lingering attack of consumption,” with his “father, sister and wife … present.”<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-013-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-013">13</a></span></span> His body was brought home and buried on 14 August 1851 in Mount Auburn Cemetery, Cambridge, Massachusetts.<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-014-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-014">14</a></span></span> It has not been possible to ascertain the further biography of Sophia Ingram (Fitch) Cruft.</p>
			<p class="Body-Text">While the Crufts were on their 1844–46 European trip, William’s sister, Annah Pickman Cruft, and his brother, James Jackson Cruft, applied for passports, on 1 December 1845 and 20 May 1846, respectively.<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-015-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-015">15</a></span></span> The only further biographical information available for Annah P. Cruft is that she was also buried (on 21 July 1888) in Mount Auburn Cemetery.<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-016-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-016">16</a></span></span> James Jackson Cruft graduated from Harvard College, BA in 1846.<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-017-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-017">17</a></span></span> In June 1846, his health failing, he sailed from New York for Marseilles, afterwards joining William, and returned home in September. In October, he entered the Medical School in Boston, but his health failed again and he withdrew in September 1847. From May to October 1848, he again traveled extensively. In April 1849, he sailed to St.&#160;Petersburg, where he suffered soon after his arrival a severe hemorrhaging of the lungs, necessitating his return home. He arrived on 21 July and on 25 August died.<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-018-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-018">18</a></span></span> He was buried in Mount Auburn Cemetery on 27 August.<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-019-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-019">19</a></span></span> The Harvard records show that he was awarded an MA in 1849.<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-020-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-020">20</a></span></span> It is possible that he was in St.&#160;Petersburg in 1846, as the record of the 1849 trip says he “again set sail for St.&#160;Petersburg.”<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-021-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-021">21</a></span></span></p>
			<p class="Body-Text">The final family member whom Anna Whistler met in Russia was Sophia Cruft’s sister, Mary Elizabeth Fitch (New Hartford, NY 27 July 1827 – after 1881). She married twice: first, on 9 February 1854, Richard Henry Winslow (d. 14 February 1861); second, Dr. R.C.M. Page, both of Westport, Connecticut.<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-022-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-022">22</a></span></span></p>
