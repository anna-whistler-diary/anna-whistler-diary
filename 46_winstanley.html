A portrait (present whereabouts unknown) of the beautiful Eliza (McNeill) Wellwood was painted by Sir Henry Raeburn (1756–1823) (see <a href="images_1.html#image40" target="_blank">Image 40</a>).<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-012-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-012">12</a></span></span> Eliza married secondly, on 1 June 1825 at Edinburgh, St. Cuthberts,<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-013-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-013">13</a></span></span> as his second wife, a widower, John Winstanley of Preston, Lancashire (Higher Walton 27 December 1776 – Preston 22 May 1859), solicitor, of the firm of Winstanley and Charnley, solicitors, of Preston. In this marriage there also were no children. It was to Eliza and John Winstanley’s home at 65 Fishergate, Preston,<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-014-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-014">14</a></span></span> that Anna Whistler came in 1829, meeting them for the first time and staying about eighteen months.<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-015-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-015">15</a></span></span> They introduced her to their friends (the Stevensons, Ormerods, Smiths of Chaddock Hall [see <a href="images_17.html#image467" target="_blank">Image 467</a>], Maudes) and relatives (other Winstanleys, the Picards, Wares, Ainsworths), all of whom figure in her diaries. It was to this same home that she came on her way to Russia in 1843, now a married woman, bringing her sons James (see <a href="images_1.html#image24" target="_blank">Images 24–29</a>), Willie (see <a href="images_1.html#image27" target="_blank">Images 27</a>, <a href="images_1.html#image30" target="_blank">30</a>), and Charles Donald, and her step-daughter, Deborah Delano (see <a href="images_1.html#image17" target="_blank">Images 17–19, <a href="images_1.html#image21" target="_blank">21</a>) (George William, her step-son, is not mentioned as being in Preston), and renewing her acquaintance with the Winstanleys’ friends and relatives after a fourteen-year absence. It was just before Anna Whistler’s arrival that Eliza recorded in August 1843 a trip of her own to see her aunt in Scotland in June of 1843 to serve as a model for the diary she encouraged Anna Whistler to keep while in Russia (see <a href="appendix_d.html">Appendix&#160;D</a>). Another trip by Anna Whistler, James, and Willie to Preston from St.&#160;Petersburg took place in the summer of 1847 (see <a href="images_17.html#image461" target="_blank">Images 461–477</a>), culminating in the marriage in Preston of Deborah Delano Whistler and Francis Seymour Haden (see <a href="images_1.html#image20" target="_blank">Image 20</a>) on 16 October of that year. In 1848, although Anna Whistler could not travel to Preston while in England, the Winstanleys visited her on the Isle of Wight (see <a href="images_18.html#image489" target="_blank">Images 489–496</a>). And finally, in June–July 1849, after the death of Major Whistler, Anna Whistler and Willie, joined by James, who was then living in England, visited Preston before returning home to America. Eliza, paralyzed in her last years, died in 1857.<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-016-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-016">16</a></span></span> Her personal estate at her death amounted to under £450, but as her husband died in 1859 “without taking upon himself Letters of administration of the personal Estate and Effects of the deceased,”<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-017-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-017">17</a></span></span> they were granted to her sister, Alicia Margaret Caroline McNeill, of Preston, on the consent of the executors of John Winstanley’s estate.<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-018-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-018">18</a></span></span> It has not been possible to ascertain where she was buried.</p>

			<p class="Body-Text">John Winstanley was the sixth son of William Winstanley (10 August 1742 – 11 November 1791), Esq., of Cuerden, afterwards of Woodcock Hall, and Alice (Woodcock) Winstanley, second daughter and co-heiress of Thomas Woodcock, Esq., of Woodcock Hall. He married twice: first on 22 October 1804 at Eccleston by Chorley, Lancashire, Margaret, daughter of Richard Hatton, Esq., of Parbold, Lancashire; and secondly, on 1 June 1825 at Edinburgh, St. Cuthberts, Eliza Isabella (McNeill) Wellwood, widow of Colonel Robert Wellwood of Garvock and Pitliver, Fife.<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-019-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-019">19</a></span></span> John Winstanley was “first listed practicing on his own as an attorney at 93 Fishergate, Preston, in 1818; and in 1821 as John Winstanley and Peter Catterall, Lune Street; the partnership moved to Fox Street in 1821. He subsequently formed the practice of Winstanley and Charnley at 2 Fox Street, Preston.”<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-020-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-020">20</a></span></span> In later years, they were listed as “Winstanley and Charnley, Solicitors, and Masters Extraordinary in Chancery … Agents to the ‘Imperial Fire and Life Assurance,’ London Agents, F. G. Gregory and Co.”<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-021-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-021">21</a></span></span> and “Winstanley and Charnley, solicitors, (agents to the Imperial Fire and Life Office) and clerks to Layton-with-Warbrick local board of health, and perpetual commissioners.”<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-022-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-022">22</a></span></span> At his death in 1859 at the age of eighty-two,<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-023-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-023">23</a></span></span> John Winstanley had outlived all his brothers and his sister. He left an estate of £20,000, which was bequeathed to both Eliza Winstanley’s and his own relatives.<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-024-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-024">24</a></span></span> Alicia McNeill was bequeathed the sum of £2,000. Anna (McNeill) Whistler, Catherine Jane (McNeill) Palmer, Charles Johnston McNeill, and John Winstanley’s nephew, William Winstanley, each received the sum of £800; an equal sum was put in trust for the children of the late General William Gibbs McNeill. Nor did John Winstanley forget his wife’s cousins –Isabella Wilkin, Priscilla Cragg, Jessie Finlay, Wilhelmina Finlay, Ann Clunie, and Wilhelmina Clunie – although he left them lesser sums. He also left a bequest to “Walter Stevenson the Elder formerly of Edinburgh and now of London,” to his daughter, Eliza Isabella (Stevenson) Smith, and to his own nephews and nieces and their children. In the case of his own relatives, he left a bequest for the maintenance of the children of his late nephew, Robert Winstanley, son of his late brother, Thomas.<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-025-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-025">25</a></span></span> He excluded Robert’s daughter, Alice, because she had been adopted by John Winstanley’s brother, William. He remembered also his nieces Elizabeth (Winstanley) Picard and Margaret (Winstanley) Ware, and the children of his late niece Sarah (Winstanley) Wray. These three women were sisters, the daughters of the late Woodcock Winstanley. He remembered as well his nephew, Rev. John Hull, of Poulton-le-Fylde, son of his late sister, Sarah (Winstanley) Hull. It has not been possible to ascertain John Winstanley’s place of burial. A portrait of John Winstanley was in the family in 1930. Its present whereabouts are unknown to me.</p>

			<p class="Body-Text">Alicia Margaret Caroline McNeill (Wilmington, NC (before 12) November 1791 – Linlithgow 20 September 1863)<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-026-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-026">26</a></span></span> was Anna Whistler’s other half-sister and the natural sister of Eliza Isabella (McNeill) (Wellwood) Winstanley. It is not clear where she lived. She frequently stayed with the Winstanleys in Preston, but the 1851 Census for Preston (when the Winstanleys were still alive) shows that she was a visitor in the home of John Richards, an attorney’s general clerk, and his wife, Betty,<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-027-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-027">27</a></span></span> while the 1861 Census for Preston (after the Winstanleys were deceased) shows that she was a lodger in the household of Esther Thompson at 8 Stanley Place. She was seventy years old in 1861, unmarried, and an annuitant.<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-028-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-028">28</a></span></span> Her Letters of Administration and will say she is “of Preston.” It was she who came to Liverpool in November 1829 to meet for the first time and take to Preston the newly arrived Anna McNeill.<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-029-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-029">29</a></span></span> Unmarried, Alicia was freer to travel both outside Great Britain and for extended periods of time. It would appear that she was in Lowell with the Whistlers in July 1834 when James was born.<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-030-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-030">30</a></span></span> Whether she then went back to England is not clear, but further references to a sojourn in the United States show that she was in America no later than 10 July 1836, in time for the birth of William Whistler.<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-031-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-031">31</a></span></span> She included North Carolina in her travels. She set out for a visit to North Carolina via New York on 27 September 1836.<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-032-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-032">32</a></span></span> She may have spent the winter of 1836 or 1837 in the warm climate of Wilmington, North Carolina, accompanying General J.G. Swift’s daughter, Louisa Josephine, there and home again because of the latter’s delicate health.<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-033-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-033">33</a></span></span> She had returned to England before 19 June 1838.<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-034-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-034">34</a></span></span> In July 1844, she came to St.&#160;Petersburg, was present at the birth of the Whistlers’ last child in August 1845, and remained with them until September 1845. In July 1849, while the widowed Anna Whistler was visiting in England on her way home to America, Alicia took James and Willie on a trip to Scotland.<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-035-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-035">35</a></span></span> She frequently traveled to Scotland, and it was there in Linlithgow on 20 September 1863 that she died “after a very short illness – On her way to Church she was suddenly seized with faintness – and shortly afterwards expired – At the time of her decease she was visiting her friend, Mrs. John Rodger, of Linlithgow on her route from Culross (where she had been staying the summer) for Preston. On the Thursday following she was interred in the Linlithgow Church Yard.”<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-036-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-036">36</a></span></span> She was buried from the house of Mrs. Rodger, whom she had known in Russia, when the latter was Miss Sophia Morgan of Edinburgh.<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-037-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-037">37</a></span></span> Her likeness, drawn by James Whistler in 1844, shows a plain, stout woman with eyeglasses (see <a href="images_1.html#image39" target="_blank">Image 39</a>).<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-038-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-038">38</a></span></span> The diaries attest to her generosity, as does her will. Her effects were under £2000. The chief portion of her estate went to her American relatives: half-sisters, half-brother, and their children. To Anna Whistler she bequeathed £250, her pearl brooch set with hair, her wardrobe “for her own use,” and “for her life the Portrait of our justly valued Sister the late Eliza Isabella Winstanley.”<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-039-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-039">39</a></span></span> She also entrusted to Anna Whistler all her remaining jewelry for distribution at her discretion among the junior members of the family. To Catherine Jane Palmer she bequeathed £250, a gold watch, gold spectacles, and a hair bracelet. At Anna Whistler’s death, the portrait of Eliza Winstanley was to go to Catherine Jane Palmer “to be kept in the family.”<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-040-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-040">40</a></span></span> Outright gifts of money were bequeathed to her half-brother, Charles Johnston McNeill (£200); the surviving children of her late half-brother, General William Gibbs McNeill: Mary Isabella Rodewald (£150) (see <a href="images_1.html#image32" target="_blank">Image 32</a>), Catherine Julia Rodewald (£150) (see <a href="images_1.html#image33" target="_blank">Image 33</a>), and Patrick Tracy Jackson McNeill £200); her nephews, James and William Whistler (£100 each); and her niece, Deborah Whistler Haden (£100). She left the residue of all her “other estate and effects after payment of … debts and testamentary expenses” to Frederick Rodewald, whom she mistakenly identified as the husband of her niece, Catherine Julia (McNeill) Rodewald, in trust for her nephew, Lt. Donald McNeill Fairfax, of the U.S. Navy (see <a href="images_1.html#image38" target="_blank">Image 38</a>). (The husband of Catherine Julia was <span class="CharOverride-1">Adolph</span> Rodewald.)

Isabella Simpson is also listed in the 1841 Census for Kirkby Lonsdale as residing in the household of Richard Picard in Wilsons yard. She was twenty-four years old and of independent means. She was listed, like her sister, in the 1851 Census as a “lodger” residing at Beck Head, “unmarried,” and an “annuitant.” Her age was given as thirty-five. In the 1861 Census for Kirkby Lonsdale, Main Street, Isabella Simpson is described as “ward,” “unmarried,” and “annuitant,” forty-five years old. In the 1871 and 1881 censuses for Kirkby Lonsdale, she continued to reside on Main Street, but was living with Jane Picard, sister of Richard Stuart Picard.

Robin Spencer, however, reads “B.S.” as “B.I.” for “Bahama Islands” (“Whistler’s Early Relations with Britain,” pp.&#160;215–216). Although “B.S.” indicates “British Subject,” some remarks on the Bahama Islands are warranted, as they were an important locale in the life of the McNeills. Two of Dr. Daniel McNeill’s sisters had married two Loyalist brothers and had settled in the Bahamas. His sister, Eliza, had married (on 24 October 1789) Archibald Taylor (d. Long Island, Bahamas 14 February 1816), a former major in the Royal Militia of North Carolina ([Obituary of Archibald Taylor], <span class="CharOverride-1">Royal Gazette and Bahama Advertiser</span>, February 7, 1816); his sister, Margaret, had married (in 1793) Duncan Taylor. When Dr. McNeill was banished from North Carolina for similar sympathies (North Carolina State Records, 1786, Department of Cultural Resources, Raleigh, NC), he may have fled to the Bahamas. It is therefore plausible that the Bahama Islands are the place of birth of his daughter, Eliza, on 27 September 1788. See William McNeill, “The McNeill Family of Bladen County,” in <span class="CharOverride-1">Bladen County Heritage, North Carolina</span> (Waynesville, NC: Bladen County Heritage Book Committee and County Heritage, 1999), vol. 1, p.&#160;210, entry 595, “McNeil–Taylor.”</span></p>

A comparison of the 1851 Census for two Preston households supports her statement; it shows that while Eliza gave her age as sixty-three, Alicia gave hers as sixty. As Alicia seems, therefore, to have been born the year her mother died (1791), it is possible her mother died of complications resulting from childbirth.
