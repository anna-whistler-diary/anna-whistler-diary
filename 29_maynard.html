			<p class="Body-Text">Edward Maynard (Madison, NY 26 April 1813 – Washington, DC 4 May 1891; see <a href="images_12.html#image329" target="_blank">Image 329</a>), the son of Moses Maynard (b. Townsend, MA 10 October 1775; d. Madison, NY 27 May 1853; buried Madison Village Cemetery) and his second wife, Chloe (Butler) Maynard (b. 22 March (?) 1777; d. Madison, NY 19 December 1821; buried Madison Village Cemetery),<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-002-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-002">2</a></span></span> “was born on a farm in upstate New York” in a town situated between Syracuse and Schenectady. There, he “attended the village school and Hamilton Academy [and] received an appointment to the Military Academy at West Point in 1831.”<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-003-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-003">3</a></span></span> Because of “ill health and a fragile disposition,” he left the Academy in “his first year and took to studying civil engineering, law, drawing, architecture and anatomy.”<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-004-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-004">4</a></span></span> In 1835, he undertook a career in dentistry, moving to Washington, DC, in 1836, where he set up private practice. He also invented numerous dental instruments, such as the “hand held drill stock.”<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-005-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-005">5</a></span></span> “In 1838, he was the first dentist to successfully use gold foil to fill the nerve cavity, including nerve canals in molar and bicuspid teeth.”<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-006-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-006">6</a></span></span></p>
			<p class="Body-Text">On 3 September 1838, Maynard married in Sherburne, New York, Ellen Sophia Doty (b. 15 October 1817; d. 3 October 1863; buried Lakewood Cemetery, Cooperstown, NY), daughter of Moses Doty and Elizabeth (Pike) Doty, and “a direct descendent of Edward Doty, … one of the original passengers on the Mayflower that landed at Plymouth Massachusetts in 1620.”<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-007-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-007">7</a></span></span> They had three sons at the time of Maynard’s trip abroad: Edward Harris (1840 – 27 April 1846), George Willoughby (b. 5 March 1843; d. 5 April 1923; buried Congressional Cemetery, Washington, DC), and John Doty (c. 1845 – after 1880).<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-008-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-008">8</a></span></span> </p>
			<p class="Body-Text">Maynard was also interested in guns. “The flintlock [system] of gun ignition which had been in use since the 1630s … was found to be awkward and time consuming and was officially replaced by the U.S. Army in 1842 by the adaption of its first percussion musket.<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-009-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-009">9</a></span></span> “In March of 1845 Maynard patented a system of priming for firearms, to take the place of the recently adapted percussion cap” (see <a href="images_12.html#image338" target="_blank">Image 338</a>).<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-010-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-010">10</a></span></span></p>
			<p class="Body-Text">On 20 March 1845, U.S. Secretary of War William L. Marcy (1786–1857) and Maynard signed a contract worth four thousand dollars selling “the privilege and right to use [the latter’s] improvements under certain expressed conditions” (the discussion of which is beyond the scope of this biographical essay). On 22 March 1845, “a similar agreement” was signed between the chief of the Naval Bureau of Ordnance and Hydrography, W.M. Crane (1776–1846), and Maynard.<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-011-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-011">11</a></span></span></p>
			<p class="Body-Text">“Encouraged by the ministers of several European countries”<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-012-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-012">12</a></span></span> but, most especially, assured by the Russian envoy to the United States, Baron Aleksandr Andreevich Bodisco (see his biography in this <a href="6_bodisco.html">Appendix</a> and <a href="images_11.html#image283" target="_blank">Image 283</a>), and the Russian envoy to Great Britain, Baron Ernst Philipp von Brünnow (1797–1875), of their country’s interest in his invention, Maynard undertook in 1845 a trip to Russia and western Europe. His journey began in Springfield, Massachusetts, on 3 July 1845. He took with him only one thousand dollars, expecting to return to the United States in approximately six months (December 1845).<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-013-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-013">13</a></span></span> Maynard left the United States having contracted with Major Thomas L. Smith, registrar of the Treasury, and General J. Washington Tyson, commissioner general for Purchasing, to put up the funds for his traveling expenses, which they failed to do, thus causing him many difficulties in the course of his journey.<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-014-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-014">14</a></span></span> Traveling with Maynard from London to St.&#160;Petersburg was George Washington Parmly (b. 22 October 1819; d. London 15 August 1892; buried Brompton Cemetery, London; see <a href="images_12.html#image339" target="_blank">Image 339</a>), an American dentist whose practice included New Orleans and Paris before he settled in London.<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-015-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-015">15</a></span></span></p>
			<p class="Body-Text">They arrived in St.&#160;Petersburg on Saturday, 20 September 1845.<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-016-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-016">16</a></span></span> On Sunday morning, 21 September, Maynard called on Major Whistler (see <a href="images_1.html#image7" target="_blank">Images 7–8, <a href="images_1.html#image21" target="_blank">21</a>) to deliver some letters to him and was taken by him to the eleven o’clock service at the English Church (see <a href="images_6.html#image110" target="_blank">Image 110</a>–111). After lunch, Major Whistler visited Maynard for several hours in the latter’s room at the misses Benson’s boarding house on the English Embankment, where he examined and admired the firearm Maynard had brought to demonstrate to Emperor Nicholas I (see <a href="images_15.html#image421" target="_blank">Images 420–423</a>) and other crowned heads of Europe. Whistler told Maynard that the emperor was not in St.&#160;Petersburg and would continue to be absent for about a month. Maynard thus realized that he could not return home before spring of 1846 and wrote his wife that he would be unwilling to undertake a second trip, if unable to accomplish his goal on this one, because of the seasickness he had suffered as well as “the inconveniences and disgusts of travelling.” He submitted his invention instead to the committee headed by His Imperial Highness Grand Duke Mikhail Pavlovich, the emperor’s brother. With time on his hands, he hired a “valet de place” and went sightseeing with Parmly. Out of boredom, frustration, and the necessity of earning money, he introduced his dental operation in St.&#160;Petersburg. His patients were not only the foreign colony of the city, but also members of the Imperial family and the aristocracy. He was thus able, from his primary profession, to pay his own expenses in St.&#160;Petersburg and to send money home to assuage his anxiety over his family’s financial straits.</p>
			<p class="Body-Text">Grand Duke Mikhail Pavlovich (see <a href="images_15.html#image439" target="_blank">Image 439</a>), on examining Maynard’s firearm, “made some remarks about the difficulty which Russian soldiers would have in managing the new lock, and the difficulty which there might be in repairing it (if damaged) by such workmen as accompany armies.”<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-017-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-017">17</a></span></span> Maynard’s response, expressed to his wife, was: “If I had known what clumsy guns were used in Europe, I would have ‘got up’ one to match. I have (of course) taken particular notice of the arms of the soldiers wherever I have been and have seen no muskets so well made as the American.”<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-018-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-018">18</a></span></span> Major Whistler, while having his teeth operated on, agreed, partly on the basis of his own experience, that if Maynard was unable to make headway “pretty soon,” he should leave Russia.<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-019-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-019">19</a></span></span> Maynard was very agitated as he contemplated his situation, which was that he had very little money in his possession, was receiving news that his wife was finding it necessary to borrow money from friends because he could not send any home, and that his flourishing practice was being abandoned by his patients the longer he stayed away.<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-020-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-020">20</a></span></span> On Friday, 7/19 December 1845, Maynard received a letter from the Russian committee rejecting his gun invention.<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-021-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-021">21</a></span></span> On Sunday, 30 December (OS), the emperor returned to St.&#160;Petersburg.<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-022-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-022">22</a></span></span></p>
			<p class="Body-Text">After his lack of success with His Imperial Highness Grand Duke Mikhail Pavlovich, Maynard hoped he might gain access to demonstrate his gun improvement to His Imperial Highness Grand Duke Alexander Nikolaevich (see <a href="images_15.html#image425" target="_blank">Image 425</a>), the future Alexander II, through his wife, Her Imperial Highness Grand Duchess Maria Aleksandrovna (see <a href="images_15.html#image426" target="_blank">Images 426–427</a>), who wished her teeth to be operated on. She, however, was ill and would have had to postpone her appointments with Maynard for so long that he could not further extend his stay in Russia.<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-023-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-023">23</a></span></span> In the midst of the peripaties of dental appointments and proposals of conditions to attract Maynard into staying in Russia because of his phenomenal reputation as a dentist, he was stunned by the arrival of a personal gift from Her Imperial Highness Grand Duchess Elena Pavlovna (see <a href="images_15.html#image440" target="_blank">Image 440</a>), whose teeth he had operated on. Hinted at early in their relationship as a distinct possibility, the gift consisted of seven hundred silver rubles and a ring “consist[ing] of a large red Garnet surrounded by fifty small diamonds, surrounded by sixteen large diamonds”<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-024-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-024">24</a></span></span> (see <a href="images_12.html#image337" target="_blank">Image 337</a>).</p>
			<p class="Body-Text">Despite his lack of success with the Russian government, Maynard met in St.&#160;Petersburg representatives of other European nations. He successfully negotiated an agreement with a merchant named Charles Thomas Grut interested in buying, as he wrote, “my right for Denmark” and willing “before the papers are made out [to] pay me in cash two thousand five hundred dollars and guarantee to give me in addition ten percent of all he receives from the government of Denmark.”<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-025-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-025">25</a></span></span> Mr. Grut soon after proposed that, together with “his brother-in-law at Copenhagen (who is very rich) … he will not only [also] take Sweden but a <span class="CharOverride-1">large part</span>, or perhaps <span class="CharOverride-1">all</span>, of Europe … even … the world, except for that part sold to the U.S.,” which Maynard encouraged him to do.<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-026-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-026">26</a></span></span> The arrangement concerning Sweden was successfully concluded in mid-January 1846.<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-027-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-027">27</a></span></span></p>
			<p class="Body-Text">On 20 April 1846, Maynard stopped in at the Whistlers’ to say goodbye.<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-028-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-028">28</a></span></span> He arrived in Berlin on Tuesday, 21 April, having failed completely to demonstrate his gun improvement to anyone in the Russian government or Imperial family who might help him. On the advice of Henry Wheaton (1785–1849), U.S. minister to Prussia, he decided that he would make no such effort in Berlin but wait until “it has been adopted in France.”<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-029-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-029">29</a></span></span> He spent a few days in Cologne and then went on to Brussels. Here, his gun was hailed by the King of Belgium, and work was begun to produce the parts for its use as a sporting gun.<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-030-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-030">30</a></span></span> Again, however, there were many delays.<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-031-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-031">31</a></span></span> While in Belgium, grief was added to his anxieties, when he received the devastating news of the death on 27 April 1846 of his firstborn son, Edward Harris.<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-032-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-032">32</a></span></span> He spent all of May, June, and July in Belgium, heading on 31 July for Paris.<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-033-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-033">33</a></span></span> He arrived in London on Tuesday 11 August, and wrote his last letter home on Monday, 16 August.<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-034-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-034">34</a></span></span> He left for home on 28 August on the <span class="CharOverride-1">Great Britain</span> from Liverpool,<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-035-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-035">35</a></span></span> arriving in New York in early September.<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-036-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-036">36</a></span></span></p>
			<p class="Body-Text">In addition to the prestige that accrued to him after his dental operations on the Russian Imperial family “he had successfully sold the rights to his [firearm] invention for Denmark and Sweden,”<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-037-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-037">37</a></span></span> and had “his Tape Primer Lock patented in France, Belgium, England, Scotland and Ireland.”<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-038-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-038">38</a></span></span> He had had an offer made to him <span class="CharOverride-1">by</span> Emperor Nicholas I, as he had wished, rather than making an offer <span class="CharOverride-1">to</span> the emperor: “Nicholas I offered him the title of ‘Actual Dentist to the Imperial Family,’ with the rank of Major, if he would agree to remain in Russia for ten years and practice and teach his [method] of practice; Dr. Maynard to be attached to the court with a salary or practice privately, whichever he might choose.” Maynard respectfully declined the offer.<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-039-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-039">39</a></span></span></p>
			<p class="Body-Text">Four more children (all daughters) were born to the Maynards: Marcia Ellen (b. 6 August 1847; d. 6 March 1926; buried Mount Hope Cemetery, Rochester, NY); Josephine Gaudette (b. Washington, DC 1 January 1850; d. Rochester, NY 14 February 1931; buried Mount Hope Cemetery, Rochester, NY); Marie (b. District of Columbia 1852; d. District of Columbia 5 August 1927; buried Congressional Cemetery, Washington, DC); and Virginia Dumont (b. District of Columbia 1854; d. 19 August 1926; buried Congressional Cemetery, Washington, DC).<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-040-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-040">40</a></span></span> In 1855, the Maynards bought a house in Cooperstown, New York. Ellen (Doty) Maynard died on 3 October 1863 of heart disease.<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-041-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-041">41</a></span></span> Maynard married in 1869 Caroline Ellen Long, called “Nellie” (b. Savannah, GA; d. Troy, NY 13 March 1923; buried Congressional Cemetery, Washington, DC), with whom he had one daughter, Edna Long (1870–1938).<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-042-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-042">42</a></span></span></p>
			<p class="Body-Text">Maynard continued to invent firearms, his “most notable inventions after the tape primer lock [being] the invention of the first metallic cartridge and the first breech loading rifle famed for its use in the Civil War.”<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-043-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-043">43</a></span></span> “The metallic cartridge was eventually adopted by the United States Government, by all manufacturers of breach [<span class="CharOverride-1">sic</span>] loading arms and eventually became the standard cartridge for all rifles worldwide.”<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-044-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-044">44</a></span></span> Having sold his Cooperstown home in late 1855, Maynard bought in 1863 “The Castle,” in Tarrytown, New York. In 1869, he sold it and returned to Washington.<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-045-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-045">45</a></span></span> He died there on 4 May 1891 of Bright’s disease, a kidney disease called “acute or chronic nephritis.” He was buried in the Maynard family plot of the Congressional Cemetery. His “grave is marked by a granite obelisk [with the inscription] ‘Dr. Edward Maynard – Surgeon – Dentist and Inventor 1813–1891’.”<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-046-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-046">46</a></span></span></p>
			<p class="Asterisk">*    *    *    *    *</p>
			<p class="Body-Text">In terms of temperament, Edward Maynard was restless; impatient; kind; humorous; and generous in the free care he gave to those who could not afford his services. He was supremely intelligent; inquisitive; observant; a man of outstanding talents; could draw quite well; had a reputation for being gentle as a dentist; was a staunch American, but unprejudicial in praising the amenities of Russian life absent in American life; and was unembarrassedly both open and allusive in his sexual remarks to his wife.<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-047-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-047">47</a></span></span></p>
			<p class="Body-Text">He was a restless person, who appreciated his wife’s understanding of his disposition. She constantly urged contentment upon him and, in her letters (not extant), approved of him remaining abroad “long enough to decide [his] affairs in some way,” knowing that he would thus be more contented when he did return home.<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-048-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-048">48</a></span></span> His letters contain many instances in which he praises contentment and the circumstances of travel and life in general that can promote it.<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-049-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-049">49</a></span></span> He encouraged his wife to read books from their library he had read and that had contributed to the “interest and enjoyment” he had experienced when actually <span class="CharOverride-1">seeing</span> examples of what he had read about. His particular example of interesting books was of landscape gardening, rural architecture, and villa architecture,<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-050-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-050">50</a></span></span> which he encountered everywhere in the environs of St.&#160;Petersburg. He wanted to be close to his wife in every way, but this desire that she read what he had read was part of his exuberance to impart information that accompanied his own active intellect. He explained in copious and intricate detail to his wife the places he visited, the makeup of objects he saw, and the functioning of equipment he observed, drawing with some talent in his letters (see <a href="images_12.html#image330" target="_blank">Images 330–337</a>) members of the Imperial family whom he met or saw (Nicholas I; the Grand Duke Mikhail Pavlovich, brother of Nicholas I); his room at the misses Benson’s boarding house; vehicles peculiar to Russian life (a drozhki, a sledge); Persian riding accoutrements at the Tsarskoe Selo Armory; a sphinx in front of the Imperial Academy of Fine Arts; the Lapplanders with their reindeer and sleigh; a guest at a masked ball; the ice hills at Catherinehoff; and front and side views of the ring given to him by Grand Duchess Elena Pavlovna as his dental patient.</p>
			<p class="Asterisk">*    *    *</p>
			<p class="Body-Text">He did not approach Russian culture and life only with condemnation. He intended to adapt many features from Russian living, expecially those having to do with insulation, to make his own house comfortable. “The walls being of such great thickness (2 to 3 feet, solid brick work) and the windows all double and every crack and crevice caulked and pasted up, the most intense cold <span class="CharOverride-1">out</span> is not heeded in-doors nor the fiercest wind heard.”<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-051-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-051">51</a></span></span> After taking a sledge ride about St.&#160;Petersburg, he planned to have a Russian-style sledge made for his family to use at their farm in Cooperstown, New York.<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-052-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-052">52</a></span></span> He showed in his letters that he was in full understanding of how these various Russian amenities were built and functioned. </p>
			<p class="Body-Text">In observing the lives of the serfs, however, his opinion was that they were more wretched than the American Negroes: “Poor devils! – Black, sour bread and salt is almost the only food the laboring class gets here. I speak of the serfs, or slaves. Our Negroes are ten thousand times better off – better clad, better, infinitely better fed, more enlightened, more cleanly, more honest, and if not more contented, they seem to be far more happy.”<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-053-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-053">53</a></span></span> At the same time, he disapproved of imitations of the Negroes by Parmly, his traveling companion to St.&#160;Petersburg, because they reflected badly on him and Maynard as Americans: “he was too fond of telling and <span class="CharOverride-1">acting</span> Negro stories, dances, etc. and Yankee stories etc. etc. all of which, though he did them very well, were always out of place and gave a character to <span class="CharOverride-1">us</span> which I did not choose to share with him.”<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-054-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-054">54</a></span></span></p>

			<p class="Body-Text">His most illustrious patient, however, was Her Imperial Highness Grand Duchess Elena Pavlovna, wife of His Imperial Highness Grand Duke Mikhail Pavlovich, and sister-in-law of Emperor Nicholas I. His meeting with her had come about in the following way. With the rejection of his gun invention, he was preparing to leave St. Petersburg, when on Sunday morning, 27 January 1846, Colonel Todd informed him that at noon or one o’clock Dr. Arndt [<span class="CharOverride-1">sic</span>: Arendt] (see <a href="images_12.html#image343" target="_blank">Image 343</a>), the emperor’s physician, would call on him. Arendt’s arrival coincided with the visit of a patient, so that Maynard was able to explain the tooth-plugging procedure to him, which highly delighted Arendt. As a result, Grand Duchess Elena Pavlovna requested Maynard’s services. Although he was planning to leave St.&#160;Petersburg in a few days along with Colonel Todd, who had been recalled, Maynard decided to stay on. Maynard informed his wife that “[Major Whistler] advised me to stay if the Court wishes to employ me, as it will be a compliment to me and to the Profession in America” and Colonel Todd agreed to remain in St.&#160;Petersburg a week longer.<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-067-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-067">67</a></span></span> Not least among Maynard’s inducements was the fact that Grand Duchess Elena Pavlovna was the wife of His Imperial Highness Grand Duke Mikhail Pavlovich, “who condemned my gun, and who may be induced, perhaps, to change his mind,” if Maynard could discuss the gun improvement with him directly.<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-068-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-068">68</a></span></span> </p>
			<p class="Body-Text">Maynard was persuaded, however, to remain for a month or two and Todd left without him. Everyone urged Maynard to keep in mind the prestige of having been invited to perform his operations on the Imperial family. Major Whistler told him “‘it will pay’ – that is to say I shall be compensated.”<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-069-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-069">69</a></span></span> The Grand Duchess Elena Pavlovna’s spokeswoman informed him that in naming a satisfactory compensation for his services “I was not to take into account what the Grand Duchess might be disposed to do afterward – by which I suppose she meant some present in addition.” As well, as a princess of Württemberg, she could endorse his gun invention to that state.<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-070-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-070">70</a></span></span></p>
			<p class="Body-Text">In their relationship, Maynard and Grand Duchess Elena Pavlovna were each themselves. He found her “extremely amiable – no nonsense – not being offended at being addressed as ‘you’ instead of ‘Your Imperial Highness’ – she has too much sense not to perceive that my manner of speech is the result of a republican education and she seems too kind not to make all due allowance for it.”<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-071-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-071">71</a></span></span> Etiquette, however, required that he perform his operations in a dress coat.<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-072-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-072">72</a></span></span> If required by most patients, he insisted that they come to his office in his room at the misses Benson’s boarding house; if required to attend members of the Imperial family, he traveled to their palaces to operate.<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-073-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-073">73</a></span></span> He charged the Imperial family fifty rubles ($37.50) per day.<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-074-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-074">74</a></span></span> </p>
			<p class="Body-Text">Grand Duchess Elena Pavlovna informed Maynard that she had “never had a Dentist operate for her who was so delicate and easy in his operations,” a statement made frequently to and about him.<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-075-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-075">75</a></span></span> She said “she would talk with [Dr. Arendt] about the way, if any, in which a school of Dentistry can be established here, under my direction.” They discussed an appointment as “Dentist to the Court,” the only appointment Maynard would consider, as he could not leave a full practice at home unless he “step[ped] into a full practice” in St.&#160;Petersburg, not only because of the financial considerations, but because he would “forfeit a high rank in a respectable and useful Profession at home to be classed with charlatans here.” Dr. Arendt had explained to Maynard the choice of conditions if he came to Russia to practice. He could “be attached to the Court at a fixed salary, and so, be compelled to go with the court wherever it might be traveling for pleasure or health or other purposes – or … have a private practice and still be Dentist to the Court, but without the fixed salary – the Court paying according to the service they receive. [Arendt] recommended the latter – having tried both ways as physician.”<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-076-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-076">76</a></span></span> Maynard did not agree to choose one of the possibilities on the spot, as requested; instead, he asked that a proposal be made to him by the emperor that he would then consider. Major Whistler, speaking from experience, expressed the opinion that if Maynard “<span class="CharOverride-1">stay[ed] now</span>, and had an office etc. etc. the fame [he] had already acquired would lead to a capital business for a time at least.”<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-077-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-077">77</a></span></span> He explained to Maynard that “it would be better to <span class="CharOverride-1">send</span> for [his wife] than to <span class="CharOverride-1">go</span> for [her], as the fever might abate during [his] absence,” noting how much more expensive life in St.&#160;Petersburg was than in Washington, DC, and the difficulties of “not yet speaking French [or] Russian.” Maynard also described for his wife what was better in Russian life than in American, including the structure of the houses, the cheapness and beauty of the furniture, and the compensating warmth of the houses in winter despite the outside cold. Amusingly, even the Benson sisters were drawn into the effort to sound out Maynard as to the conditions under which he would remain in St.&#160;Petersburg and practice dentistry.<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-078-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-078">78</a></span></span> </p>
			<p class="Body-Text">Through the endorsement of Maynard by Her Imperial Highness Grand Duchess Elena Pavlovna, Count Pyotr Andreevich Kleinmikhel’ (see <a href="images_9.html#image243" target="_blank">Image 243</a>), Major Whistler’s superior, chose to have Maynard operate on him and on one of his daughters.<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-079-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-079">79</a></span></span> Her Imperial Highness Grand Duchess Maria Aleksandrovna, wife of His Imperial Highness Grand Duke Aleksandr Nikolaevich, Heir to the Throne, also wished to engage his services,<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-080-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-080">80</a></span></span> while Her Imperial Highness Grand Duchess Elena Pavlovna herself wished to have her children operated on.<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-081-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-081">81</a></span></span> The Countess Kleinmikhel’, wife of Major Whistler’s superior, decided not to have her teeth operated on because she was frightened by Maynard’s fees.<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-082-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-082">82</a></span></span> Within the court circle, he possibly also operated on a daughter of “General Alderberg,” describing the child’s father as “said to be only second to one … in the favor of the Emperor.”<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-083-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-083">83</a></span></span></p>
			<p class="Body-Text">Although Maynard had been told by Grand Duchess Elena Pavlovna’s spokeswoman that he might receive a personal gift, he was nevertheless overwhelmed when the secretary of his patient brought him seven hundred silver rubles and a ring consisting of “a large red Garnet surrounded by fifty small diamonds, surrounded by sixteen large diamonds”<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-084-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-084">84</a></span></span> (see <a href="images_12.html#image337" target="_blank">Image 337</a>). Because of the generous gesture of Grand Duchess Elena Pavlovna, Maynard, who had not drawn her likeness in any of his letters, bought a small plaster bust of her, “taken several years ago, but still very much like her,” so that his wife might “form a pretty correct idea of her.”<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-085-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-085">85</a></span></span></p>

			<p class="Body-Text">He also told Maynard that “so much of what he [himself] has heard about what Americans have done in Europe is false that he looks with suspicion upon all such big stories.” For example, although an American newspaper had reported that Nicholas I “had conferred the Order of the Black Eagle upon ‘Professor Risley’ the gymnast” (see <a href="images_8.html#image202" target="_blank">Image 202</a>), Whistler assured Maynard that this was not true and that “Risley attracted no notice whatever here – could only get an engagement in [<span class="CharOverride-1">sic</span>: one] night in a week to perform, etc. and that he was an exceedingly vulgar, illiterate fellow.”<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-094-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-094">94</a></span></span></p>

			<p class="Endnote-text"><span id="endnote-001"><a class="_idEndnoteAnchor _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-001-backlink">1</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am deeply grateful to Rodney S. Hatch III of North Salem, New York, great-great-great grandson of Dr. Edward Maynard, for permission to quote from his forebear’s copies of nineteen letters written by Maynard to his wife in 1845 and 1846 from Russia and Europe, all published by Hatch in <span class="CharOverride-1">Dr. Edward Maynard “Letters from the Land of the Tsar 1845 –1846”: America’s Pioneering Dental Surgeon Turned Civil War Gun Inventor</span>. When fortuitously found by Hatch in 1997, these typescripts of the letters lay in “an old metal filing cabinet … stored [by Hatch’s father] in a garage in upstate New York since 1969” (Hatch, <span class="CharOverride-1">Dr. Edward Maynard</span>, pp.&#160;iv, vii, viii). Since Hatch published his book, the original letters have come to light; they are in the possession of his cousin, Cynthia McGrath. She has graciously given me photocopies of important drawings made by Maynard within the letters (for example of Nicholas I and his brother Grand Duke Mikhail Pavlovich), and of his room in the boarding house of the misses Benson in St.&#160;Petersburg. Hatch’s book contains drawings, but because he was publishing typewritten copies of Maynard’s letters, without drawings, he used a professional artist to recreate them based on Maynard’s verbal descriptions. I have therefore chosen not to use them, as at least one drawing is of the wrong person, and Maynard’s original drawings are now available. </span></p>

			<p class="Endnote-text2">Lucy Sherrard Finley (Sunderland, Durham 15 April 1817 – London 13 November 1893; see <a href="images_12.html#image340" target="_blank">Image 340</a>) was the fourth child and eldest daughter of the ten children of Mary Anne (York) Finley (b. Southwark, London 1793; bap. St. Saviour’s, Southwark, May 1793; d. New South Wales 1877; buried Dubbo Cemetery, New South Wales) and Matthew Smith Finley (Monkwearmouth, County Durham 12 December 1778 – Tower Hamlets, London 24 February 1847), an East London school teacher. Her parents were married on 25 April 1810 at St. Dunstan’s near London Bridge. Lucy’s maternal grandparents were William York (b. Whatcote, Warwick 8 September 1770), a perfumer, and Elizabeth (Sherrard) York (b. c. 1770). Lucy’s mother had a childless uncle, Joseph Sherrard (b. 20 February 1773; bap. St. George the Martyr, Southwark 20 February 1773; d. Deal, Kent 17 April 1835), a ship’s purser in the Royal Navy, to whom she was very close. Lucy received her middle name from this family and her first name from Joseph Sherrard’s wife, Lucy (Rowlett) Sherrard (b. 5 July 1774; bap. St. Sepulchre, Holborn, London 1 August 1774; d. Deal, Kent 7 October 1832). This great-uncle of Lucy’s, who had spent several years in His Majesty’s Service in Australia, retired in England. The principal beneficiaries in his will were his niece, Mary Anne (York) Finley and her first daughter, Lucy, and first son, Matthew Smith Finley Jr. To Lucy, Joseph Sherrard bequeathed £500 sterling, which she was to receive when she attained the age of twenty-one years; as she was only seventeen, the interest was, in the meantime, to be paid to her annually.</p>
			<p class="Endnote-text2">With this inheritance, Lucy set up a toy business registered in her name at her parents’ address: 4 Waterloo Terrace. “Toy” in this period meant “a knick-knack or ornament” as well as “a child’s plaything.” When Lucy went to Russia, the business continued to appear under her name until 1846, but in 1848, her mother, upon Lucy’s marriage in Russia, transferred it to her own name, either because Lucy had married abroad or because Lucy’s father’s death in 1847 had made it imperative that her mother seriously earn a livelihood.</p>
			<p class="Endnote-text2">Two possibilities for why Lucy went to Russia have been suggested: (1) she came from seafaring stock – her paternal grandfather had traveled to St.&#160;Petersburg at least once with a cargo of hemp, and her great-uncle Joseph Sherrard had made a career in the Royal Navy – whom she heard narrate their adventures; and (2) the legacy made it possible for her to undertake her need to work by going as far away as she wished and engaging in the respectable profession of governess – an alternative to being in trade – and being able to do so in a country where that profession – for a foreigner – had greater advantages and rewards than in England. </p>
			<p class="Endnote-text2">The fact that she worked for Count Muraviev-Vilenskii (see <a href="images_12.html#image342" target="_blank">Image 342</a>) for eight years suggests that she went to Russia no earlier than June 1839, according to the date of an insurance policy (Nick Fielding, “Before She Went to Russia – Lucy’s Early Life,” <span class="CharOverride-1">Siberian Steppes</span> (blog), accessed July 2, 2021 https:// siberiansteppes.com/2016/07/15/before-she-went-to-Russia-lucys-early-life/; Burials in the Year 1847 in the City of London and Tower Hamlets Cemetery; Baptisms in St. George the Martyr, Southwark, Surrey, 1758–1812; Baptisms in St. Sepulchre, Holborn, 1766–1787; IGI FHL Film 1786328, item 1, p.&#160;236; Marriages in St. Benet Fink, London; <span class="CharOverride-1">Dover Telegraph and Cinque Ports General Advertiser</span>, May 2, 1835; <span class="CharOverride-1">Maidstone Journal and Kentish Advertiser</span>, October 16, 1832; Baptisms in Southwark, St. Saviour, 1781–1808; Dubbo New South Wales Deaths, 1788–1945, registration no. 4986. See also Fielding, <span class="CharOverride-1">South to the Great Steppe</span>). </p>
			<p class="Endnote-text2">The financial situation of Lucy’s mother in England may explain why Edward Maynard did not charge Lucy for his services or even perhaps that she chose not to disclose that she had received an inheritance. The revealed characters of both Lucy Finley and Edward Maynard suggest that neither would have lied. See also Benson in this <a href="3_benson.html">Appendix</a>.</p>

The Englishman at Mr. Ropes’s house cannot be identified with certainty, but he could have been William Clarke Gellibrand, Mr. Ropes’s brother-in-law. “Mrs. Ropes” was Ellen Harriet (Hall) Ropes; her sister was Emily Hall, who was visiting them from England and died in St.&#160;Petersburg in April.
