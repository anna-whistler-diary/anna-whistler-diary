			<p class="Body-Text">Thomas Scales Ellerby (Manchester, Lancashire 18 March 1810 – Toronto, ON 11 June 1892; see <a href="images_10.html#image256" target="_blank">Image 256</a>)<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-002-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-002">2</a></span></span> was the son of Martha (Scales) and William Ellerby. His father, a bookseller, was the agent to a religious tract society at No. 15 Picadilly, Manchester.<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-003-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-003">3</a></span></span></p>
			<p class="Body-Text">Thomas Scales Ellerby, having “from infancy … enjoyed the inestimable privileges arising from the instructions and examples of parental piety, and at an early age [been] deeply impressed with sentiments of religion,”<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-004-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-004">4</a></span></span> left his parents’ home in Manchester when he was fourteen. While away from home, he lost his piety and religion. “This was [his] character during a residence of nearly seven years in Leeds, and whilst attending the ministry of the Rev<span class="CharOverride-9U">d</span> R.W. Hamilton – and also that of [his] relative the Rev. Thomas Scales.”<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-005-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-005">5</a></span></span> On returning to his parents in Manchester, he eventually regained his faith through “the ministerial labours of the Rev<span class="CharOverride-9U">d</span> D<span class="CharOverride-9">r</span> McAll.”<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-006-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-006">6</a></span></span> In Manchester, he worked as a clerk in the firm of Radford’s and Company, iron founders and merchants, for four years until “the death of a confidential Servant” resulted in his being offered the post. As his acceptance “would … have been quite inconsistent with [his] views as to the ministry,” he consulted with Dr. McAll and the Rev. Mr. Scales and as a result declined the offer and instead set about “pursuing a course of private study.” He wrote a memoir called <span class="CharOverride-1">Memorials of Felix Neff, the Alpine Pastor</span> in 1833.<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-007-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-007">7</a></span></span> He had taught in “Dr. McAll’s Sabbath School, … been a visiting member of the Christian Instruction Society and … frequently addressed small congregations both in Manchester, and in an adjourning village.” He was “admitted to the communion of Dr. McAll’s church in February 1834.” In applying to the non-conformist Highbury College on 22 April 1835, he stated that he had “just completed his twenty-fourth year.<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-008-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-008">8</a></span></span></p>
			<p class="Body-Text">Thomas Scales Ellerby attended Highbury College from 1835 to 1839. On 3 July 1840, he was married to Mary Bealey (c. 1810 – 18 August 1885), daughter of Ralph Bealey, bleacher, at the Providence Chapel, High Street, Rochdale, Lancashire, according to the rites and ceremonies of the Independents, by John Ely, Minister of Leeds.<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-009-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-009">9</a></span></span> He was ordained at Islington Chapel, Middlesex, on 15 July 1840, for the English and American Church in St.&#160;Petersburg,<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-010-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-010">10</a></span></span> which “was opened for public worship” on 24 August / 5 September 1840.<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-011-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-011">11</a></span></span> The Ellerbys lived in “very nice apartments” in the church, which was “a very neat and pretty building, large, airy and roomy,” with an organ.<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-012-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-012">12</a></span></span> Ellerby served in St.&#160;Petersburg from 1840 to 1853.<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-013-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-013">13</a></span></span> In a history of the church, his sermons were said to have been “thoughtful and scholarly,” and he himself was described as “possessed of great ability and tact.”<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-014-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-014">14</a></span></span> A parishioner said they “like[d] him very much,” found him “very amiable – pious &amp; devoted &amp; withal a good scholar, tho not so eloquent a speaker as Mr. [J. Croumbie] Brown.”<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-015-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-015">15</a></span></span> There was a great increase in the membership of the church during his tenure.<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-016-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-016">16</a></span></span> In 1844, he started Sunday services at the Alexandrofsky Head Mechanical Works (see <a href="images_9.html#image223" target="_blank">Images 223–225</a>) – holding them at Joseph Harrison Jr’s, house (see <a href="images_9.html#image239" target="_blank">Images 239–240</a>) – for the English and American mechanics employed there, “and partly as a result of these efforts there came into existence the Congregational Church at Alexandroffsky.”<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-017-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-017">17</a></span></span> A feature of his preaching at Alexandrofsky was an annual sermon to the young.<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-018-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-018">18</a></span></span> His poor health “compelled him in 1845, and again in 1849, to leave” Russia for a time, which created some difficulties, as he did not have a clergyman in his congregation who might stand in for him.<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-019-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-019">19</a></span></span> While in England in 1845, he wrote “an appeal to the British Legislature,” asking that, as the British and American Chapel, “since [its] formation … twenty-five years ago,” had performed divine worship and regularly observed “the Rites of Baptism, and Burial according to the usages of the Congregational Dissenters of Great Britain,” its “right to perform the Marriage Ceremony” be recognized.<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-020-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-020">20</a></span></span> In May or June 1853, his health failed “to such a degree that the physician thought the delay of another week dangerous.”<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-021-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-021">21</a></span></span> He was safely in England by 2/14 June, and the fears that he might never “be able to live and labor again in [the] climate” of St.&#160;Petersburg proved true.<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-022-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-022">22</a></span></span></p>
			<p class="Body-Text">The<span class="CharOverride-1"> BRBC STP 1845</span>, which also contains entries made in not-always-specified subsequent years, carries the information that the Ellerbys had two sons and two daughters and that “Eleonora Lee, nurse, spinster,” lived with them at the Chapel.<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-023-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-023">23</a></span></span> In 1846, the Ellerbys had at least three daughters,<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-024-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-024">24</a></span></span> and in 1848, the <span class="CharOverride-1">BRBC STP 1845 </span>lists the three daughters as Lucy (St.<span class="CharOverride-3" lang="ar-SA">&#160;Petersburg</span> c. 1842 – Toronto, ON 18 July 1920), Alice (St.<span class="CharOverride-3" lang="ar-SA">&#160;Petersburg</span> 1844 – Toronto, ON 19 December 1900), and Emily (Manchester, Lancashire c. 1845 – Toronto, ON 29 January 1930).<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-025-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-025">25</a></span></span> </p>
			<p class="Body-Text">There is information that Ellerby next served as chaplain of the British Embassy in Vienna, but a check of Foreign Office lists of clergy at British embassies has failed to confirm this.<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-026-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-026">26</a></span></span> He then settled in Toronto, Ontario, where he was pastor from 29 May 1856 to March 1866 of Zion Congregational Church, “historically, … the mother church of congregationalism in Ontario.”<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-027-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-027">27</a></span></span> In 1866, he joined establishment:<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-028-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-028">28</a></span></span> i.e., the Anglican Church. “He was ordained deacon on 28 October 1866, by the First Bishop of Huron”<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-029-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-029">29</a></span></span> and, on 17 February 1867, priest. In 1866–1867, he served as incumbent of Exeter, from 1867–1870 was curate of St. George’s Church in Toronto, and from 1870–1882 incumbent of St. George’s in Sarnia, Ontario.<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-030-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-030">30</a></span></span> He was superannuated from the Diocese of Huron in 1882<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-031-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-031">31</a></span></span> and took up residence again in Toronto, where, “on the death of Rev. Johnstone Vicars, in 1886 [he] was appointed by the London Society for Promoting Christianity amongst the Jews to succeed him as their Canadian Agent, settled in this city.”<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-032-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-032">32</a></span></span> Although elderly, Rev. Ellerby “threw himself into this work with great energy,” pursued “it with more than ordinary ability, perseverance and success,” and seems to have held this post until his death.<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-033-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-033">33</a></span></span> In 1888, in her will dated 8 September, Mary Tyler (Ropes) Gellibrand, who had been a communicant of the British and American Chapel in St.&#160;Petersburg when Rev.
