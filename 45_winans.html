			<p class="Body-Text">Ross Winans (Sussex County, NJ 14 October 1796 – Baltimore, MD 11 April 1877; see <a href="images_9.html#image228" target="_blank">Image 228</a>), the future Baltimore locomotive builder, married on 22 January 1820 in New Jersey Julia DeKay (10 August 1800 – 21 May 1850).<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-002-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-002">2</a></span></span> They had five surviving sons and one daughter: Thomas DeKay (1820–1878; see <a href="images_9.html#image229" target="_blank">Image 229</a>), William Lewis (5 April 1823 – 22 June 1897; see <a href="images_9.html#image232" target="_blank">Image 232</a>), Julia DeKay (1825–1875; see <a href="images_1.html#image16" target="_blank">Image 16</a>), Ross Jr. (August 1831 – Paterson, NJ 25 June 1863), DeWitt Clinton (1838 – 27 November 1892), and Walter Scott (1840–1928).<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-003-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-003">3</a></span></span></p>
			<p class="Body-Text">Ross Winans had come to Baltimore in 1827, when the work of building the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad (B&amp;O), the first railroad in the United States, began. He had become interested in this mode of transportation and had “devised a model ‘rail wagon’, having the ‘friction wheel’ with outside bearings,” that became “for at least a century the distinctive pattern for railroad wheels.”<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-004-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-004">4</a></span></span> In 1828, the B&amp;O sent George Washington Whistler (see <a href="images_1.html#image7" target="_blank">Images 7–8, <a href="images_1.html#image21" target="_blank">21</a>), Ross Winans, William Gibbs McNeill (see <a href="images_1.html#image31" target="_blank">Image 31</a>), and Jonathan Knight to England, where they remained from November of that year to May 1829 “to study the railroad system.” When Ross Winans returned home, he became an engineer (1829–1830) for the B&amp;O.<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-005-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-005">5</a></span></span> “In 1835 he and his partner, George Gillingham, took over the company shops at Mount Clare.”<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-006-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-006">6</a></span></span> “About 1840 Winans began a career as an independent locomotive builder, setting up his own shops adjacent to the Mt. Clare Station.”</p>
			<p class="Body-Text">When the Russian government expressed its wish to have the rolling stock for the St.&#160;Petersburg–Moscow Railway built in Russia by a company that would be willing to relocate, Major Whistler proposed Ross Winans. When the model locomotive that Winans built to compete with an “English firm also building a locomotive for Russia” was “shipped … in the spring of 1843, Ross Winans did not wish to leave his factory in Baltimore but sent instead his son Thomas, also a gifted mechanic, to put it into operation.”<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-007-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-007">7</a></span></span></p>
			<p class="Body-Text">Thomas DeKay Winans (Vernon, Sussex County, NJ 6 December 1820 – Newport, RI 10 June 1878; see <a href="images_9.html#image229" target="_blank">Image 229</a>) is the only member of the Winans family who appears in Anna Whistler’s St.&#160;Petersburg diaries. He was ten years old when his family moved to Baltimore. He received “a common-school education” and was then “apprenticed … to a machinist, under whom he displayed such skill that before he attained his majority he was entrusted with the headship of a department in his father’s establishment.”<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-008-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-008">8</a></span></span> He became acquainted with Major Whistler when, “scarcely eighteen years old, he [was] charged with the delivery of some engines for the Boston and Albany Railroad.” It is, therefore, not surprising that his father also entrusted him with the delivery and setting up of the model locomotive in Russia, and that Major Whistler had no objection.</p>
			<p class="Body-Text">On route to Russia, Thomas DeKay Winans met Joseph Harrison Jr. (see <a href="images_9.html#image226" target="_blank">Image 226</a>), of the firm of Eastwick and Harrison, who had been invited by the Russian government “to come to Russia to bid for the locomotive contract.”<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-009-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-009">9</a></span></span> Harrison invited Winans “to participate with him in the negotiations.”<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-010-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-010">10</a></span></span> They were awarded the contract, for some three million dollars, which they “signed on December 27, 1843/January 8, 1844.”<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-011-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-011">11</a></span></span> The contract was for six years.<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-012-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-012">12</a></span></span> The partnership was now called Harrison, Winans and Eastwick.</p>
			<p class="Body-Text">Thomas DeKay Winans was a bachelor, who, like the Harrison and Eastwick families, lived in the “village on the grounds” of the Alexandrofsky Head Mechanical Works (see <a href="images_9.html#image223" target="_blank">Images 223–225</a>), as did “the government workers with their families.”<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-013-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-013">13</a></span></span> Anna Whistler (see <a href="images_1.html#image1" target="_blank">Images 1–5</a>) records in her diaries that he could not leave the Works during the day and came only at night to consult with Major Whistler. Unlike the Harrisons and Eastwicks, he is never mentioned as attending any of the festivities at the Whistler home, nor does Anna Whistler ever record that he was present when they visited the Harrisons and Eastwicks. She mentions seeing him on only one occasion, when they took Aunt Alicia (see <a href="images_1.html#image39" target="_blank">Image 39</a>) to visit the Harrisons and showed her the foundry where the locomotives were being built. As a bachelor, he seems to have moved in completely different circles and thus to have met Celeste Louise Revillon (c. 1828 – Baltimore, MD 19 March 1861; see <a href="images_9.html#image230" target="_blank">Images 230–231</a>), then eighteen years old, who, until 1847, had been away “at school in Paris for the last four years.”<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-014-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-014">14</a></span></span> She was the daughter of George Revillon (1802 – 24 March 1859) and Marguerite Louise (Bonjour) Revillon.<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-015-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-015">15</a></span></span> “Her father [was] at the head of a large type foundry” in St.&#160;Petersburg and had resided there from about 1837.<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-016-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-016">16</a></span></span> She did “not speak English and Mr. Wynans knowledge of French [was] limited, but they both [had] some knowledge of the Russian language.”<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-017-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-017">17</a></span></span> They were married on 11/23 August 1847 “in [both] the British and American Chapel [see <a href="images_6.html#image125" target="_blank">Image 125</a>] and the Catholic Church.”<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-018-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-018">18</a></span></span> Probably because Anna Whistler was in England with James and Willie at the time of the Revillon–Winans wedding, she does not record this event. The Winanses’ first child, George, was born on 30 March 1849 at Alexandrofsky.<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-019-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-019">19</a></span></span> Their second son, Ross Revillon (1850–1912), was also born in Russia.<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-020-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-020">20</a></span></span></p>
			<p class="Body-Text">It is said that Ross Winans’s second son, William Lewis (Vernon, Sussex County, NJ 3 April 1823 – London 22 June 1897; see <a href="images_9.html#image232" target="_blank">Image 232</a>),<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-021-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-021">21</a></span></span> went to Russia at the same time as Thomas DeKay, but he himself stated that he “resided 16 years in the state of Maryland, from whence [he] removed in the year 1845, to St.&#160;Petersburg in Russia.”<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-022-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-022">22</a></span></span> “In Russia he seems to have played a very minor role in the activities of Harrison, Winans and Eastwick, not being a formal member of the firm.”<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-023-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-023">23</a></span></span> “Although the firm … remained legally in existence until October, 1850,” Eastwick left Russia in May 1849, after a quarrel with Harrison and Thomas Winans.<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-024-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-024">24</a></span></span> It was then that William Lewis Winans came to play a major role in the firm. On 21 October (OS) 1849, they “formed a formal partnership with [him]” called Winans, Harrison and Winans, and on 25 August (OS) 1850 signed a six-year contract with the Russian government “for the remount (repair and maintenance) of the moving machinery of the St.&#160;Petersburg and Moscow Railway.”<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-025-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-025">25</a></span></span></p>
			<p class="Body-Text">The articles of their agreement put William Lewis Winans completely in control. He was to manage “all matters connected with the carrying out of the contract, having sole power to make decisions” and had “to remain in Russia for the full term of the contract,” while his brother and Harrison “could leave Russia if they wished,” never to return.<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-026-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-026">26</a></span></span> Nor was he obliged to act upon advice from either of them, unless that partner returned to live in Russia.<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-027-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-027">27</a></span></span></p>
			<p class="Body-Text">Thomas DeKay Winans left Russia for the United States in September 1850. Eastwick, who had returned to Russia in 1850, left permanently for the United States in October of that year, after being bought out. Harrison returned to the United States in December 1852, after spending “1851–52, in England and travelling on the Continent.” William Lewis Winans remained in Russia, “manag[ing] the Alexandrovsk Factory until 1862.”<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-028-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-028">28</a></span></span> All became very rich.<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-029-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-029">29</a></span></span></p>
			<p class="Body-Text">Thomas DeKay Winans returned to Baltimore. He built two lavish houses, one in Baltimore, called “Alexandroffsky,” after the place in Russia where he had lived; the other, a country house outside Baltimore, called “Crimea.”<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-030-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-030">30</a></span></span> He also built a villa at Newport, which he called “Bleak House.”<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-031-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-031">31</a></span></span> Two more children were born: William (2 March 1852 – 9 December 1871) and Celeste Marguerite (1855 – February 1925). George died in August 1851.<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-032-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-032">32</a></span></span> When their mother died in 1861, the three remaining children were eleven, nine, and six years old, but there is no indication that Thomas DeKay Winans married again. William predeceased him.</p>
			<p class="Body-Text">Thomas DeKay Winans devoted much of the rest of his life to inventions: “the cigar-shaped hull which he and his father devised in 1859, designed for high-speed steamers in trans-Atlantic service”; “a device which made the organ as easy of touch as the piano”; “a mode of increasing the strength and volume of sound on the piano”; “an improvement in ventilation which he applied at ‘Alexandroffsky’”; “glass feeding vessels for fish, adopted by the Maryland Fish Commission”; “an ingenious use of the undulation of the waves to pump the water of a spring to the reservoir at the top of his villa at Newport, R.I.”<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-033-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-033">33</a></span></span> He also “had a natural skill in clay-modelling.”</p>
			<p class="Body-Text">He is said to have come out of retirement twice: once to “serve as a director” of the B&amp;O when it was completed, and once to establish “a soup station opposite his home” in 1861, when the Civil War broke out.</p>
			<p class="Body-Text">William Lewis Winans married on 30 November / 12 December 1851 at the British and American Congregational Church in St.&#160;Petersburg, Rev. T.S. Ellerby (see <a href="images_10.html#image256" target="_blank">Image 256</a>) officiating, Maria Ann Delarue (1825 – Hove, Sussex 18 December 1904).<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-034-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-034">34</a></span></span> They had two sons: Walter (Alexandrofsky, Russia 5 April 1852 – Parsloes Park, Barking, Essex 12 August 1920) and Louis William (Russia 1857 – Hove, Sussex 31 October 1927).<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-035-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-035">35</a></span></span> Apart from running the Alexandrofsky Head Mechanical Works, he succeeded William Hooper Ropes as American consul in St.&#160;Petersburg in 1854; he resigned that post on 15/27 March 1856.<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-036-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-036">36</a></span></span></p>
			<p class="Body-Text">In 1862, “a consortium of French capitalists won the ‘remount’ contract through a lower bid,”<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-037-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-037">37</a></span></span> and William Lewis Winans settled permanently in England. “In 1865, the Russian government, dissatisfied with [the French],” invited the Winanses “to resubmit their bid.”<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-038-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-038">38</a></span></span> In 1866, Thomas DeKay and William Lewis Winans traveled to Russia once more, this time to sign an eight-year contract. “With them was associated Major George Washington Whistler’s son, George William Whistler, in the firm of Winans, Whistler and Winans.”<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-039-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-039">39</a></span></span> In 1868, the Russian government bought them out, “reimburs[ing] them for their outlay [and] paying them a bonus of several million dollars.”<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-040-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-040">40</a></span></span></p>
			<p class="Body-Text">The 1881 Census for London shows that the home of William Lewis Winans was next to Kensington Palace, and that he had a staff of eighteen servants to care for a household of four.<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-041-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-041">41</a></span></span> At his death, he left an estate of over £20 million.<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-042-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-042">42</a></span></span></p>
			<p class="Body-Text">Of the remaining siblings of Thomas DeKay Winans, mention should be made only of his sister, Julia DeKay (New Jersey 24 October 1825 – Newport, RI 26 September 1875; see <a href="images_1.html#image16" target="_blank">Image 16</a>), who married on 18 June 1854, as his second wife, George William Whistler (New London, CT 9 July 1822 – Brighton, Sussex 24 December 1869; see <a href="images_1.html#image12" target="_blank">Images 12–13</a>), James Whistler’s half-brother.<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-043-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-043">43</a></span></span></p>

In the first half of the 1850s, he was superintendent of the Erie, and New York and New Haven railroads and lived in New York.<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-045-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-045">45</a></span></span> He frequently visited James (see <a href="images_1.html#image24" target="_blank">Images 24–29</a>) at West Point and, like all the other family members, was worried about whether James, because of his continuing demerits, would be allowed to complete the course of study at the USMA. On 18 June 1851, George and Mary (Ducatel) Whistler became the parents of a son, George Worthen Whistler (d. 28 March 1908). Mary became very ill and both she and the baby were sent to Baltimore to be taken care of by her family.<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-046-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-046">46</a></span></span> In addition to Mary Ann, Julius Timoleon Ducatel (Baltimore, MD 6 June 1796 – Baltimore, MD 23 April 1849; see <a href="images_1.html#image14" target="_blank">Image 14</a>) and Joanne Barry (Baltimore, MD 1800 – Baltimore, MD 16 November 1873) had four other daughters. Eliza Ducatel (bap. 6 March 1827 – 1852), who had married on 29 February 1851 Alonzo V.

			<p class="Body-Text">George William Whistler, who had earlier been employed by Ross Winans and had resigned in a huff before marrying Mary Ducatel, moved to Baltimore and reestablished contact with the Winans family.

			<p class="Body-Text">After 1850, Winans, Harrison and Winans carried out remount (repair and maintenance) work on the St. Petersburg–Moscow Railway. In 1865, the Russian government, dissatisfied with the consortium of French capitalists to whom they had given the remount contract in 1862, invited the Winanses to rebid. In 1866, Thomas DeKay and Willam Lewis signed an eight-year contract. The firm by now was called Winans, Whistler and Winans. George William Whistler had been living in St. Petersburg since at least 1856, as his second child, Thomas Delano, was born there in 1856.<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-070-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-070">70</a></span></span> This had not pleased Anna Whistler.

On 24 February / 8 March 1869, in St.&#160;Petersburg, George William Whistler added a codicil to his will. In both his will and the codicil, where he changed the size of their shares, he divided his estate among his wife, Julia DeKay; the children of their marriage; and the child of his first marriage, George Worthen.<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-074-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-074">74</a></span></span> In 1869, the family moved to Brighton, England. There, on 24 December 1869, George died of heart failure, as his father had. Joseph Harrison Jr. wrote Anna Whistler a letter of condolence, which she sent to Julia DeKay Winans. In Anna Whistler’s response to Harrison, she described George’s last months:</p>

Everything on it was razed in the spring of 1926 and replaced by commercial buildings. “Crimea” became “part of the city parks system” and “still stands in Leakin Park.” All of the foregoing information is taken from an article by Margaret McCampbell and Lance Gifford, “Grand Estate on Baltimore’s West Side: Alexandroffsky,” <span class="CharOverride-1">Maryland</span> (Winter 1979): pp.&#160;26–31. “Crimea” even had a “servants burying ground,” now vanished, where “the mostly Irish servants of the family” were interred (Jane Bromley Wilson, <span class="CharOverride-1">The Very Quiet Baltimoreans: A Guide to the Historic Cemeteries and Burial Sites of Baltimore</span> [Shippensburg, PA: White Mane, 1991], p.&#160;102).

Walter Winans became an outstanding sportsman. He was an excellent shot and a talented sculptor, especially of the horse. In 1912, at the Olympic Games in London, he was awarded both the gold medal for hunting-rifle shooting and the gold medal for sports sculpture. For ten years he was world-champion pistol shot. He frequently traveled to Russia to hunt. He was a great lover of horses and had a racing stable containing several horses of the Orlov breed and a stud farm in Austria. “He … executed a beautiful statue of Joan of Arc, copies of which were … sold for the benefit of the French Red Cross Fund.” He was “the owner of Surrender Park, in Kent.” He inherited real estate at Ferry Bar, Maryland, from his father.
