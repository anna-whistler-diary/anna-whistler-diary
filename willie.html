			<p class="Heading-1">The Whistlers As They Were in the 1840s</p>
			<p class="Heading-2">William McNeill Whistler (Willie)</p>
			<p class="Body-Text">William Whistler (see <a href="images_1.html#image27" target="_blank">Images 27</a>, <a href="images_1.html#image30" target="_blank">30</a>), the child and adolescent, was seven to almost thirteen years old during his sojourn in Russia. Like James (see <a href="images_1.html#image24" target="_blank">Images 24–29</a>), he was beautiful to look at and for several of their early years they resembled one another. In the Dessain portrait (see <a href="images_1.html#image27" target="_blank">Image 27</a>), they almost look like twins, and are both slender. But Willie was robust in health compared to James: “round, ruddy and hard as a Spitsbergen Apple.”<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-001-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-001">1</a></span></span> He did not suffer from a major chronic illness, nor did he fall sick from minor bouts of cold and flu as often as his older brother. In 1848, however, possibly because he was entering puberty, Willie became fat. In June of that year, after he had been on an inspection trip with his father while James was suffering from another attack of rheumatic fever, Anna Whistler recorded how fat he was.<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-002-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-002">2</a></span></span> He had a face “like ‘plum pudding Jack.’”<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-003-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-003">3</a></span></span> Even in referring to his excellent progress in his studies, his mother, calling him “our little Parson elect,” exclaimed “what a student the fat boy is.” He became thinner while attending Baxter’s Commercial School that fall,<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-004-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-004">4</a></span></span> perhaps because he was so unhappy there.</p>
			<p class="Body-Text">In temperament he was gentle, tractable, obedient, studious, probably slow in his speech and deliberate in his movements,<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-005-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-005">5</a></span></span> and a homebody. As he was “rather less excitable than Jemmie, &amp; therefore more tractable,” Anna Whistler (see <a href="images_1.html#image1" target="_blank">Images 1–5</a>) preferred to take “this gentlest of my dear boys” as her interpreter when she went shopping.<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-006-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-006">6</a></span></span> Observing Willie during their 1847 trip to England, she felt that in his manliness as he strode “about the deck holding the Capt’s hand &amp; talking German so eagerly with him”; in his “lovely combination of gentleness and determination to do what is right”; in his constant concern for her when she was seasick, he “was prompted by his dear father, whom he is so much like.”<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-007-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-007">7</a></span></span></p>
			<p class="Body-Text">An obedient child, he held his parents’ views and mouthed similar thoughts. He accepted that his mother approved only of puppet shows but not of the theater. He was surprised that James attended private parties in England that he and their parents had seen held up to ridicule in <span class="CharOverride-1">Punch</span>.<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-008-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-008">8</a></span></span> He did not understand how James, knowing that their parents disapproved of such snobbish parties, would nevertheless participate and risk injury to his health as well.<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-009-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-009">9</a></span></span> Major Whistler’s last words to him, “Goodbye, be a good boy,”<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-010-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-010">10</a></span></span> were hardly necessary.</p>
			<p class="Body-Text">Anna Whistler constantly held Willie up for James to emulate.<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-011-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-011">11</a></span></span> Recounting to him the abusive treatment Willie suffered at Baxter’s, she asked him whether he was not sorry that he was “ever … rough to so gentle and loving a brother?”<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-012-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-012">12</a></span></span> None of this changed James’s nature, nor did it mar or weaken the brothers’ close relationship, which lasted until Willie’s death.<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-013-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-013">13</a></span></span></p>
			<p class="Asterisk">*    *    *</p>
			<p class="Body-Text">While Koritskii (see <a href="images_7.html#image167" target="_blank">Images 167–170</a>) had been engaged solely to give drawing lessons to James, Willie took drawing lessons from their regular tutor, Mr. Biber, but there was a certain amount of interaction: Koritskii lent models to Mr. Biber;<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-014-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-014">14</a></span></span> Willie was present when Koritskii came to their home on Saturdays; and on at least one occasion Koritskii drew him. Willie was thus engaged in seeing Koritskii drawing and at work with James and participated in the excitement of that atmosphere. We know that he painted some watercolors for James when the latter was sick, that he went to the Academy in March of 1847 to sit to Koritskii for his portrait and saw the exhibits there, and that there is documentation for his acquaintance with Briullov (see <a href="images_7.html#image173" target="_blank">Image 173</a>). But James’s enrollment at the Academy apparently prompted him to want to take a drawing course, too.</p>
			<p class="Body-Text">In 1846, when James was not enrolled, Willie, who was nine years and seven months old, was registered in Drawing Course 1: “From Originals of Heads” (see <a href="images_7.html#image162" target="_blank">Image 162</a>).<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-015-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-015">15</a></span></span> Koritskii signed the receipt book at the Academy on 18 February / 2 March 1846, and paid nine rubles for ticket No. 341, which was issued to “Villiam Uistler, son of a Major in American service” (see <a href="images_7.html#image161" target="_blank">Image 161</a>).<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-016-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-016">16</a></span></span> “Villiam” is also registered in the “Book of Addresses of Academy Pupils for 1846” (see <a href="images_7.html#image162" target="_blank">Image 162</a>),<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-017-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-017">17</a></span></span> but only his ticket number and name are recorded. In the columns for noting down documents presented in order to register, and for his address, nothing appears. He was one of 475 students registered for 1846.<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-018-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-018">18</a></span></span> Willie seems even to have submitted a drawing at a monthly examination just two weeks later: “341. Uistler, Villiam” in Course 1 was ranked “28” in a group of 52 students for his drawing at an examination held on 2 March 1846 (14 March NS).<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-019-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-019">19</a></span></span> His ranking was reassessed and changed to “38” (see <a href="images_7.html#image162" target="_blank">Image 162</a>).<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-020-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-020">20</a></span></span></p>
			<p class="Asterisk">*    *    *</p>
			<p class="Body-Text">Willie was the only Whistler child to remain in St.&#160;Petersburg until his father’s death. Parting with James in the fall of 1848 distressed him very much “&amp; for some time, [he] could not bear to hear [James’s] name mentioned without the tears coming to his eyes.”<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-021-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-021">21</a></span></span> Once he was back in Russia, the question of his education became paramount, and his parents did not know whether to hire tutors or send him to a private school. They considered hiring a previous tutor, Monsieur La Roche, to teach him again,<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-022-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-022">22</a></span></span> but ended up sending him to Baxter’s Commercial School.<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-023-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-023">23</a></span></span></p>
			<p class="Body-Text">He tried very hard to please his parents by being a good student. He had hated boarding at Monsieur Jourdan’s in 1846, and the necessity of parting with his mother on Sunday night after a day-and-a-half weekend at home had inevitably reduced him to tears.<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-024-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-024">24</a></span></span> In his homesickness, he was “a complete Whistler,” very like his father and his half-brother, Joseph Swift Whistler. <span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-025-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-025">25</a></span></span> While Anna Whistler had sympathized with him “tenderly” then, duty, she had felt, required her to conceal her sympathy in the hope that “time may reconcile him to his privations.” Asked by her whether he wanted to stay home instead, he had bravely answered that “it is right to go to school and I will do all fathers wishes.” He had brought her “the best testimonials from his masters,” and she did not think he would “disappoint his father.” It was the same when he was sent to Baxter’s. He “dislike[d] going there so much”<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-026-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-026">26</a></span></span> and “was sad when the weather forced him to have to board for a few days.”<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-027-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-027">27</a></span></span> For a while, Anna Whistler reported, “the boys flocked around him as a natural curiosity, <span class="CharOverride-1">because he is an American</span>,” but then let him alone, “call[ing] him <span class="CharOverride-1">Independent</span>.”<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-028-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-028">28</a></span></span> She also reported that he became “the pet of the whole school,” loved by “all the boys and all the teachers.”<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-029-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-029">29</a></span></span> How long “all the boys” loved him is not clear, because he wrote to James, telling him of the continuing hazing and rough treatment he received: “they cuff him and taunt him, call him ‘American monkey’, ‘Milk Sop’ etc., when he asks them about the lessons he is to learn, they ‘have to get their own’ and will not oblige him, yet when he takes out his white roll to eat … for the 3 o’clock recess … they beg him and he never refuses to share it.”<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-030-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-030">30</a></span></span> Each evening, he recounted to his mother “the vexations of the day,” and she, who had held English boys up as an example of good manners for her wild sons, decided that “the English lads here are of a degenerated stock.” Major Whistler (see <a href="images_1.html#image7" target="_blank">Images 7–8</a>, <a href="images_1.html#image21" target="_blank">21</a>) counseled him “either to become entirely independent of the boys in lessons play and all, or to knock down any who touches him” and “to become hardened to rough and tumble.”<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-031-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-031">31</a></span></span> Willie pointed out that “they attack him in a gang” and wished that the fearless James “were at the same school with him to fight his battles which he cannot do himself” because “his gentle spirit is principled against tit for tat.”<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-032-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-032">32</a></span></span> His parents, who could do nothing, simply hoped that eventually the other boys might “find out what a high principled lad the Yankee is and that merit and forbearance will meet its reward.” Despite his unhappiness at Baxter’s, close to the end of their stay in Russia he was second in his class.<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-033-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-033">33</a></span></span></p>
			<p class="Body-Text">Dr. Rogers advised them to send him back to England to study, as apparently in the climate of St.&#160;Petersburg there was a risk even “to a healthy boy in going from heated rooms to extreme frosty atmosphere, before and after daylight.”<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-034-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-034">34</a></span></span> Had Major Whistler lived, and had James come home for the summer of 1849, Willie would most certainly have gone back to England with his feisty brother.</p>
			<p class="Body-Text">When he stopped in England with his mother on the decimated family’s journey home, she sent him for that brief period to take lessons from the clergyman with whom James was studying,<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-035-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-035">35</a></span></span> ever aware of the fragmented education both were receiving. They could also be a solace to one another and talk of their father.</p>
			<p class="Body-Text">Willie “scarcely knew Jim,” who had “grown so very tall and look[ed] much fatter than he used to.”<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-036-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-036">36</a></span></span> They both had their daguerrotypes taken, as did Anna Whistler, by Kilburn (see <a href="images_1.html#image29" target="_blank">Images 29–30</a>; the whereabouts of the daguerreotype of Anna Whistler are unknown to me).<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-037-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-037">37</a></span></span> One of the few cultural events in London that Willie and Anna Whistler attended was the Royal Academy exhibition, where they saw James’s portrait by William Boxall (see <a href="images_1.html#image28" target="_blank">Images 28</a>, <a href="images_8.html#image209" target="_blank">209</a>).<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-038-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-038">38</a></span></span> Aunt Alicia (see <a href="images_1.html#image39" target="_blank">Image 39</a>) took the boys on a trip to Scotland.<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-039-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-039">39</a></span></span> They visited Preston, Liverpool, Fleetwood, and all the old haunts, saying what at that difficult moment might have seemed permanent goodbyes to their relatives and friends.<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-040-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-040">40</a></span></span> On 29 July 1849 they sailed for home.</p>
			<p class="Asterisk">*    *    *</p>
			<p class="Body-Text">The documentation for Willie’s biography comes from the diaries and the family correspondence. Neither contains any mention of him as a pupil at the Imperial Academy of Fine Arts. The information in the Pennells’ correspondence with the Academy, while surprising and confusing, revealed that perhaps Willie had also attended the Academy, and my own research in the Russian State Historical Archives in St.&#160;Petersburg and the Pennell–Whistler Papers at the Library of Congress showed that there was indeed documentation for this supposition.</p>

Whether they were present in the child and adolescent is not supported by any manuscript or printed document I have consulted. I assume that as the quality of excitability was present in the young James, so slowness and deliberateness were features of the young Willie. Perhaps they were the result of a birth trauma.</span></p>

			<p class="Endnote-text2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The documentation showing that Willie attended the Academy is confused and puzzling. The confusion arises when we consult the “Examination Book for 1843, 1844, 1845, 1846 and 1847,” which contains “List of IAFA pupils who have received numbers for their drawings in the examination taking place on 3 March (OS) 1846.” Of the fifty-two students (listed non-alphabetically by surname only from 1 to 52) who took the examination in the course “From Originals of Heads,” “Uistler” is rated “38.” There is thus in this document a discrepancy in the date of the examination (3 March [OS] instead of 2 March [OS]) and in the number received for the drawing (38 instead of 28). In this list “28” was received by the student named “Zubov.” Confusion could have been eliminated had each student’s class admission ticket number been noted down as well, but unfortunately it was not. If we compare a group (thirteen) from these fifty-two surnames with the same surnames listed in “The Inspector’s Class Journal for 1846, 1847 and 1848” for 2 March (OS) 1846, we find that the numbers they received for drawings coincide in both documents in the case of eight students, while in the case of five students, including Whistler, the numbers received for drawings do not coincide in both documents. Three of the five had a number which differed in each document. Two students received the same number in the class journal, but only one of them could and did receive that number in the list of fifty-two students, a decision probably made by the vice-president. The day of the examination and the evaluation of the drawing may have been changed, but, according to the records, the examinee was ticket holder No. 341, who was registered in the Academy in 1846, and he was William Whistler.</p>
