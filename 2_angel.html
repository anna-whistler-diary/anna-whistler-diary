			<p class="Heading-2">Angel</p>
			<p class="Body-Text">It is difficult to trace Miss Angel before December 1842 and after September 1843. As recorded in Eliza Winstanley’s diary (<a href="appendix_d.html">Appendix&#160;D</a>), she wrote her name in Eliza Winstanley’s pocketbook as “Eliz<span class="CharOverride-9U">th</span> Angel,” but is called in a theater bill announcement, it would therefore seem erroneously, “Miss M. Angel.”<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-001-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-001">1</a></span></span> “Elizabeth Angel” may, moreover, have been her stage name. There is thus little to anchor her with and help find her dates; we can nevertheless present a biography of her for this short period based chiefly on non-genealogical sources.<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-002-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-002">2</a></span></span></p>
			<p class="Body-Text">A “Miss Angel” appeared in productions at the Theatre Royal, Manchester, from December 1842 to 9 June 1843 before transferring to the Adelphi Theatre, Edinburgh.<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-003-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-003">3</a></span></span> Her first appearance there was on 28 June 1843, when she was referred to in a billing as “Miss M.

			<p class="Body-Text">At the Theatre Royal, Manchester, in January 1843, Miss Angel appeared as Cora in <span class="CharOverride-1">Pizarro</span>.<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-007-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-007">7</a></span></span> A benefit in her honor, just before her departure from Manchester, was performed on 30 May 1843: she played the role of Mariana in <span class="CharOverride-1">The Wife: A Tale of Mantua</span>, by Sheridan Knowles (1784–1862).<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-008-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-008">8</a></span></span> On Wednesday, 7 June 1843, she was to appear in Knowles’s <span class="CharOverride-1">The Secretary</span> as Lady Laura Gaveston, but she was indisposed.<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-009-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-009">9</a></span></span> On 28 June 1843, “Miss M.

			<p class="Body-Text">Miss Angel’s tutor, “to whom she was apprenticed,” was Edward William Elton (London August 1794 – Lindisfarne 20 July 1843; see <a href="images_3.html#image76" target="_blank">Image 76</a>), “the well-known actor of the Theatres Royal Drury-lane and Covent-garden.”<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-013-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-013">13</a></span></span> She lost her tutor when Mr. Elton died in the fatal wreck of the steamer <span class="CharOverride-1">Pegasus</span> off the Holy Island of Lindisfarne on 20 July 1843.<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-014-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-014">14</a></span></span> He left seven motherless children, who became orphans, “the youngest not eight years of age.”<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-015-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-015">15</a></span></span> A subscription in aid of them, which was enthusiastically greeted by the public, was announced in the <span class="CharOverride-1">Morning Post</span> (London) on 7 August 1843.<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-016-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-016">16</a></span></span></p>
			<p class="Body-Text">Assessment of Miss Angel as an actress varied according to people’s positions as theater reviewers, theater managers, and theater audiences. In December 1842, she was described after her first performance in Manchester, when she played Desdemona, as someone who would “acquire a position of no little eminence in the company,” if she “continue[d] to please as in this her first effort.”<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-017-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-017">17</a></span></span> Her appearance and presentation were described in the same review as follows: </p>
			<p class="Quote">She has a clear, transparent face, through which there is seen a mind of no ordinary cast, whilst her manner is at once easy and graceful, winning upon her audience by its very simplicity. We were glad to find so little stage trick about her (for a professed <span class="CharOverride-1">pupil</span>), and if she would but discard the false mode of pronouncing some of her words (a mode which we know to be very fashionable among many of our leading actors…), we should be mightily pleased with her, – it was indeed the only little blemish we could discover. Presuming her to be but recently acquainted with the stage, her Desdemona was a beautiful performance.<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-018-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-018">18</a></span></span></p>
			<p class="Body-Text">When her benefit was announced, it was stated that “No member of the <span class="CharOverride-1">corps dramatique</span> of our Theatre Royal is more deserving of the public than Miss Angell … Independently of her great accomplishments as an actress, her ladylike demeanour in social life, and her many excellent qualities of heart and mind, entitle her to general support.”<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-019-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-019">19</a></span></span> “Her style is pure, her manners graceful, and in the lighter shades of tragic character, or in the refinement of high comedy, we know few actresses of the present day who can compete with her. It will be long, we fear, before we have an actress equal to her in merit.”<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-020-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-020">20</a></span></span> It was felt by then that “the higher range of tragedy” was not her fort<span class="CharOverride-5" lang="ar-SA">é</span>, that while she was “full of exquisite grace and fine feeling – the very perfection of gentleness – she [was] deficient in the grandeur of tragic passion, more from physical weakness than mental appreciation.” A reviewer’s appreciation of her talent caused him to urge the theater manager, Mr. Roxby, to exhibit “a careful judgement in filling the vacancy” caused by her departure from the company.<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-021-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-021">21</a></span></span></p>
			<p class="Body-Text">In Edinburgh, to which she had gone with Edward Elton, the theater columnist pointed out that her debut there was considered “far from successful.” He felt that the “indiscriminate applause” and “injudicious praise … lavished upon her in Manchester” had been “fatal to [her] rising talent” and had caused her to wrongly estimate her “present status” as a actress.<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-022-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-022">22</a></span></span></p>
			<p class="Body-Text">When Eliza Winstanley met her in the coach, Elizabeth Angel had possibly already moved to Edinburgh, but she had not yet made her debut there. She was also deeply distressed at that point by her relationship with Samuel Lennox, who remained behind in Manchester as a comedian at the Queen’s Theatre, but we do not know whether he had already become involved with the Miss Craven whom he married some eighteen months later. Miss Angel mysteriously alluded to her circumstances and seemed not to care whether she lived or died. This is the background for the concern both Eliza Winstanley and the “old Gentleman” felt for her.</p>
