			<p class="Body-Text">Mary Brennan (bap. 20 May 1828 – 25 May 1895) had a brother, James (1 February 1822 – 4 September 1886), who emigrated to the United States, arriving in New York on 9 May 1840.<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-002-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-002">2</a></span></span> Both were born in Ballyhale, Kilkenny, Ireland, the children of Martin and Mary (Maher) Brenan [<span class="CharOverride-1">sic</span>].<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-003-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-003">3</a></span></span> It seems plausible that Mary Brennan, because she was a minor, arrived in the United States with James.</p>
			<p class="Body-Text">James Brennan took out initial naturalization papers in 1842 in Springfield, Massachusetts, and became a citizen of the United States on 20 February 1849 at the Hampden County Court of Common Pleas in Springfield.<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-004-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-004">4</a></span></span> He resided in Springfield until his death.<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-005-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-005">5</a></span></span></p>
			<p class="Body-Text">His occupation in the 1840s was probably that of laborer.<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-006-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-006">6</a></span></span> In the early 1850s, he was employed by the Western (Boston and Albany) Railroad, and from the 1860s to 1880, his occupation is listed specifically as both fireman and engineer for the Western Railroad.<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-007-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-007">7</a></span></span></p>
			<p class="Body-Text">James Brennan married Mary Hogan, but it has not been possible to locate a marriage record for them. Mary (Hogan) Brennan, who was born around 1827, died in Springfield on 26 July 1889, at the age of sixty-two.<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-008-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-008">8</a></span></span> She as well was born in Ireland. According to the 1860 U.S. Federal Census (where the surname is spelled Brinnan), they had five children: Anna (14), John (12), Mary (9), James (6), and Margaret (1). Their daughter, Mary, married John Barrett, had three children, and lived in Springfield until her death at the age of eighty-one on 2 June 1931.<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-009-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-009">9</a></span></span> It is to Mrs. Barrett that her aunt gave or ordered to be given (it was not bequeathed) the portrait of James Whistler painted in 1844 in St.&#160;Petersburg by C.A.F. Fiessler<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-010-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-010">10</a></span></span> (see <a href="images_1.html#image24" target="_blank">Image 24</a>) and presented to to Mrs. Barrett’s aunt by Anna Whistler (see <a href="images_1.html#image1" target="_blank">Images 1–5</a>).</p>
			<p class="Body-Text">Another Brennan brother, Patrick, was a carpenter, living in Stonyford, County Kilkenny, Ireland, not far from Ballyhale.<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-011-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-011">11</a></span></span> His interest in emigrating to the United States in 1850<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-012-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-012">12</a></span></span> may have been connected with the fact that their mother died in Ireland in late 1849 or early 1850.<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-013-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-013">13</a></span></span> But Mary received a letter from him on 25 June 1850, saying he had decided “to remain in Stoney Ford.”<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-014-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-014">14</a></span></span></p>
			<p class="Body-Text">While we know when Mary Brennan was baptized, we have no birth date for her, and documents for her marriage and death and the 1860 U.S. Federal Census give her age variously.<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-015-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-015">15</a></span></span> All of the ages given indicate that when she went to work for the Whistlers she had to have been less than ten years old, which seems unlikely. If we assume that she was baptized in the year in which she was born, she would have been about fifteen in 1843, when we know for certain that she was in their employ. She may have been in their employ, however, from at least October 1842, when Anna Whistler and the children moved from Springfield to Stonington after Major Whistler’s (see <a href="images_1.html#image7" target="_blank">Images 7–8, <a href="images_1.html#image21" target="_blank">21</a>) departure for Russia.<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-016-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-016">16</a></span></span></p>
			<p class="Body-Text">She traveled to Russia with Anna Whistler and the children in August 1843. Not long after their arrival, partly because of the death of Charles Donald, who had been her particular charge, she proposed returning to her brother James in Springfield, but then decided not to.<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-017-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-017">17</a></span></span> Anna Whistler made efforts to arrange for her to have the companionship of nursemaids in the employ of other Whistler family friends, such as the Ropeses and Ellerbys. Mary became more courageous about making friends, but she seemed to seek out only other nursemaids.<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-018-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-018">18</a></span></span> Arrangements were made on several occasions for her to travel to the United States and to visit her family in Ireland.<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-019-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-019">19</a></span></span> She accompanied Anna Whistler and the children to England in the summers of 1847<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-020-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-020">20</a></span></span> and 1848, and remained in London in 1848 with Deborah Whistler Haden (see <a href="images_1.html#image17" target="_blank">Images 17–19, <a href="images_1.html#image21" target="_blank">21</a>),<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-021-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-021">21</a></span></span> who was expecting her first child in December of that year. Thus, like James Whistler (see <a href="images_1.html#image24" target="_blank">Images 24–29</a>), Mary never returned to St.&#160;Petersburg again.</p>
			<p class="Body-Text">When Anna Whistler returned to the United States in the summer of 1849, she lived in Stonington with the Palmers (see <a href="images_1.html#image37" target="_blank">Image 37</a>) while deciding upon a more permanent place of residence, and Mary remained with her.<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-022-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-022">22</a></span></span> Mary continued in the employ of Anna Whistler throughout most of the 1850s, but her situation was somewhat unstable. There are unexplained outbursts of rude behavior toward Anna Whistler recorded in the latter’s diary for January 1850, when they were living in Pomfret, their first move,<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-023-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-023">23</a></span></span> but they may have been connected with the death of Mary’s mother.</p>
			<p class="Body-Text">The peripaties of Anna Whistler’s life and her financial difficulties seem to have been the cause of the instability of Mary’s life. Anna Whistler was poor after Major Whistler’s death, and the visits she made to family and friends were partly intended to save her money. Mary did not accompany Anna Whistler when the latter traveled to England for extended stays with family, nor when she went to visit her brother, Charles Johnston McNeill, in Florida. Anna Whistler also made visits in the United States to close friends – such as the Eastwicks, Harrisons, and Winanses – but it is not always clear what Mary did then. She may have gone to stay at these times with her brother James, whom she frequently visited.<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-024-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-024">24</a></span></span> Both she and Anna Whistler suffered on these occasions.</p>
			<p class="Body-Text">At Christmas 1852, Anna Whistler was in London with the Hadens and did not return home until May 1853.<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-025-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-025">25</a></span></span> She was concerned about having to write twice to Mary Brennan because she had not heard from her.<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-026-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-026">26</a></span></span> In April of 1854, Anna Whistler and Mary were in Stonington when the former received an invitation to visit Baltimore. This left Mary disconsolate, and the offer to take her along drew only great indignation because Mary was afraid “to meet any <span class="CharOverride-1">linked</span> with our breaking up.”<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-027-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-027">27</a></span></span> Nevertheless, despite her fears, Mary was with Anna Whistler in Baltimore in autumn of 1854.<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-028-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-028">28</a></span></span> Although she told Anna Whistler in December 1854 that she wanted to return to her New York connections,<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-029-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-029">29</a></span></span> she stayed on. In 1855, because of her poverty, Anna Whistler shared a house with her nephew Donald McNeill Fairfax (see <a href="images_1.html#image38" target="_blank">Image 38</a>) and his first wife, Virginia Cary (Ragland) Fairfax, in Baltimore until April, but Mary was with her.<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-030-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-030">30</a></span></span> In late November – early December 1855, with Anna Whistler’s permission, Mary visited her brother James for two weeks.<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-031-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-031">31</a></span></span> In December of 1856, expecting that Anna Whistler would go to visit Charles Johnston McNeill in Florida, Mary informed James Brennan that he might “hope for her spending the winter in Springfield.”<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-032-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-032">32</a></span></span> Mary found herself forced to stay in Springfield, to the mutual trial of herself and Anna Whistler, while Willie Whistler contemplated where he would next pursue his studies.<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-033-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-033">33</a></span></span> Anna Whistler hoped Mary might find employment in Springfield with Mrs. Barnes, until she herself could “see [her] way clearer,”<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-034-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-034">34</a></span></span> but that does not seem to have happened. Mary “cheered herself with the hope that Willie” might induce his mother “to keep house for him in Phila. and that she [might] be [their] fag again! never to leave [their] house!”<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-035-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-035">35</a></span></span></p>
			<p class="Body-Text">In the winters of 1858–59 and 1859–60, Mary Brennan was again or still living in Springfield and was unable to leave there to help Anna Whistler move before spring 1860.<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-036-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-036">36</a></span></span> She apparently had taken a new position in the late 1850s, for in 1860 she was registered in the U.S. Federal Census for Springfield and enumerated as a servant (Brinnin, age twenty-eight) living with Ellen Child [<span class="CharOverride-1">sic</span>], a widow, at 6 Chestnut Street.<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-037-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-037">37</a></span></span> The interesting fact in this census return is that one of the other two female servants in the Childe household was an Ellen Bergen, nineteen years old. She was most likely a relative of Martin Bergin, whom Mary Brennan married on 9 June 1861, at St. Michael’s Roman Catholic Cathedral in Springfield.<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-038-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-038">38</a></span></span></p>
			<p class="Body-Text">Martin Bergin (25 September 1834 – 4 May 1897) was also born in Ireland and was, like the Brennans, from Kilkenny.<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-039-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-039">39</a></span></span> He arrived in New York in July 1851 and note was made that he was a minor.<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-040-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-040">40</a></span></span> He was “naturalized in the Superior Court of Hampden County in Springfield. No specific date is given, but the naturalization occurred between 1853–1867.”<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-041-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-041">41</a></span></span> It had to have occured before 1862, when Anna Whistler refers to New Haven as the Bergins’ domicile.<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-042-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-042">42</a></span></span></p>
			<p class="Body-Text">His occupation is given in the marriage record as “grocer.” Although his place of residence is given there as Springfield, his name does not appear in the Springfield directories at all. In their marriage record, in 1861, Martin and Mary both give their age as twenty-six, making Mary two years younger than she was in the 1860 U.S. Federal Census. Their witnesses were James Welsh and Anne Bergin, and the officiating cleric was M.P. Gallagher. Martin’s parents are given as Stephen and Ellen. His mother’s maiden name was Murphy.<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-043-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-043">43</a></span></span> The names of Mary’s parents are not given.</p>
			<p class="Body-Text">Mary (Brennan) Bergin died at 586 Grand Avenue in Ward 6, New Haven, Connecticut, on 25 May 1895.<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-044-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-044">44</a></span></span> Her death certificate lists her age as fifty-six, but the age she gave on her marriage record in 1861 would have made her sixty years old at her death, and her baptism date suggests she was sixty-seven. The death notice in the <span class="CharOverride-1">New Haven Register</span> states that Mrs. Martin Berigan [<span class="CharOverride-1">sic</span>] would receive a solemn requiem mass at St. Patrick’s Cathedral in New Haven.<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-045-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-045">45</a></span></span> Her body was brought by train to Springfield on 27 May 1895. After her funeral service, she was buried in “cemetery plot #1259 in the Hill Section of Calvary Cemetery in [nearby] Chicopee.”<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-046-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-046">46</a></span></span> The plot was purchased by her husband when she died.<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-047-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-047">47</a></span></span></p>
			<p class="Body-Text">Martin Bergin “was in the grocery and meat business” in New Haven.<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-048-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-048">48</a></span></span> At some time, he served as an alderman.<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-049-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-049">49</a></span></span> He sold his business there, apparently after his wife’s death, “and intended to open a store in [Springfield] or Holyoke.”<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-050-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-050">50</a></span></span> On 4 May 1897, while visiting his relatives in the Holyoke area, he died tragically in a hotel in Holyoke owned by a niece of his. The gas jet in his room “had not been turned fully off,” and he died of asphyxiation.<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-051-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-051">51</a></span></span> His funeral took place on May 5 at the Church of the Holy Rosary, and he was buried in the same plot as his wife.<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-052-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-052">52</a></span></span> They had no surviving children.<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-053-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-053">53</a></span></span></p>
			<p class="Body-Text">Mary Brennan was devoted to the Whistler family. Her particular faithfulness to Anna Whistler was exemplified on Christmas Day 1845, when she gave her mistress “a carved ivory seal for [her] desk” with her initials on it in silver and “a chaste cart dog at the top.”<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-054-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-054">54</a></span></span> On route to England in June 1847, Anna Whistler wrote her husband, assuring him for some unclear reason that Mary was not spoiled, but “modest, humble &amp; trying to anticipate all our wants.”<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-055-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-055">55</a></span></span> Mary seemed to justify this assessment when she offered to sleep on the floor of the cabin because of a lack of berths.<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-056-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-056">56</a></span></span></p>
			<p class="Body-Text">When Major Whistler died, Mary communicated to Anna Whistler that she would not leave her and perhaps offered to take a smaller salary, for Anna Whistler wrote to James: “Tell my good Mary how gratifying it is to me to hear such proofs of her attachment to me—she will cheerfully then lighten my toils—for we must all do our part upon a very small income.”<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-057-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-057">57</a></span></span> Anna Whistler described the hardworking young woman as “a host in herself.”<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-058-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-058">58</a></span></span> And, as late as 1874, she received proof “of the faithful and loving attachment of [her] good old servant Mary who altho a very respectable M<span class="CharOverride-9">rs</span> Bergin residing in New Haven … sign[ed] herself [your] ‘Servant Mary’.”<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-059-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-059">59</a></span></span> To this Anna Whistler responded: “There are not many like her.”<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-060-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-060">60</a></span></span></p>
			<p class="Body-Text">A third surname needs to be grouped with Brennan and Bergin: that of Keefe (O’Keefe, Kief, O’Kiefe). Anna Whistler referred to a Thomas in 1849 when she wrote of James Brennan.<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-061-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-061">61</a></span></span> While identifying James as Mary Brennan’s brother, she did not clarify who Thomas was. But, as a sister of Martin Bergin later married a Thomas Keefe, also from Ballyhale, Kilkenny,<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-062-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-062">62</a></span></span> it seems plausible to assume that the abovementioned Thomas was Thomas Keefe. He was born on 9 August 1824 and arrived in New York on 1 August 1841,<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-063-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-063">63</a></span></span> about a year after James Brennan. He made his domicile in Springfield, Massachusetts, from at least 1842, and became a citizen of the United States on 15 February 1847.<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-064-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-064">64</a></span></span> In 1852, he was working at the Springfield depot.<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-065-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-065">65</a></span></span> He married Margaret Bergin on 8 May 1853 in Cabotville (now Chicopee), Massachusetts.<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-066-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-066">66</a></span></span> The names of Margaret Bergin’s parents are not given in the marriage record<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-067-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-067">67</a></span></span>; only the name of Thomas Keefe’s father, Richard, is given. Thomas’s occupation is given in the U.S. Federal Census for 1860 (Chicopee) as mason.<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-068-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-068">68</a></span></span> At that time, the Keefes had three children: Mary (6), John (4), and Ella (2).<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-069-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-069">69</a></span></span> Thomas Keefe is not recorded in the 1870 U.S. Federal Census, so he may have died between 1860 and 1870.

The KAS found only one baptismal record for a Mary Brennan in Ballyhale in the period 1823–1833. This Mary Brennan had three siblings, born in 1830, 1832, and 1835. Anna Whistler never refers to them in her correspondence, so perhaps they died. That this Mary Brennan is the one we are looking for seems borne out by the fact that a James Walsh was a sponsor at the baptism in Ballyhale, and a James Welsh was a witness at her wedding in Springfield (M. Humberston, Springfield, MA, to E.&#160;Harden, 11 January 2002).</span></p>

Brennan). In August 1849, he and someone named Thomas offered through Mary Brennan that wherever Anna Whistler chose to live they were willing “to leave their work for a few days if [she needed] their assistance in unpacking the furniture” arriving from Russia. James Brennan promised that he would help his mother “if he can get the same wages he had formerly,” because “his work is increased and his profits reduced under the present system” (Anna Whistler to James Whistler, Stonington. Aug. 23rd. 1849, GUL: Whistler Collection, W389).</span></p>
			<p class="Endnote-text"><span id="endnote-007"><a class="_idEndnoteAnchor _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-007-backlink">7</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When James Brennan acquainted Anna Whistler with his situation in 1849 (see previous Note), she felt she had to ask her step-son, George, to write to a Mr. Gray about a job for him (Anna Whistler to James Whistler, Stonington. August 23rd. 1849, GUL: Whistler Collection, W389). Henry Gray (c. 1814 – 19 December 1870), a brushmaker in Boston, had received “proprietorship of one of the restaurants” on the Providence and Stonington Railroad in 1838 through Major Whistler. He later joined Major Whistler in Springfield and became a collector on the passenger trains of the Western Railroad, succeeding to master mechanic. On the retirement of General James Barnes as superintendent of the Western Railroad in 1850, Henry Gray was appointed to the position, which he held for seventeen years (“Death of Henry Gray,” <span class="CharOverride-1">Springfield Daily Republican</span>, December 20, 1870). He apparently did help James Brennan, as the latter was employed by the Western Railroad starting in the 1850s. See <span class="CharOverride-1">Bessey’s Springfield Directory for 1851-1852</span> (Springfield: M. Bessey, 1851), p.&#160;44 (name spelled Brannon). James Brennan is not indexed in the 1850 US Federal Census. The 1860, 1870, and 1880 censuses all identify his occupation.</span></p>

			<p class="Endnote-text"><span id="endnote-016"><a class="_idEndnoteAnchor _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-016-backlink">16</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;It is known that the Whistlers had a nursemaid named Mary while in Stonington, and that she left their employ to marry. Her marriage took place on 12 January 1840. A Mary Russell was traveling on the ill-fated <span class="CharOverride-1">Lexington</span> (see <a href="images_2.html#image46" target="_blank">Image 46</a>), which burned at sea on 13 January, while on route from New York to Stonington. Her purpose in traveling to Stonington had been to take leave of the Whistlers (<span class="CharOverride-1">Boston Transcript</span>, January 25, 1840; <span class="CharOverride-1">Salem Gazette</span>, January 28, 1840). It seems plausible to assume that Russell was her married name. The details of this terrible disaster, in which only 4 passengers were saved, are to be found in Benjamin F. Thompson, <span class="CharOverride-1">History of Long Island from Its Discovery and Settlement to the Present Time</span>, ed. Charles J. Werner, 3rd ed., 3 vols. (New York: Robert H. Dodd, 1918), vol. 1, pp.&#160;411–420. The Whistlers moved to Springfield in the summer of 1840. There is no evidence, however, that Mary Brennan, who had probably arrived in the United States in May 1840 with her brother and would have gone with him to Massachusetts, replaced Mary Russell. I wish to thank Colonel (retired) Merl M. Moore of Falls Church, Va., for the <span class="CharOverride-1">Boston Transcript</span> reference. Colonel Moore, when we met in the late 1980s, was engaged in research on American artists up to 1860 and was affiliated in his project with the National Portrait Gallery in Washington, DC.</span></p>

The first Catholic parish in Springfield was not established until 1847, while the earliest Catholic church in the area, Holy Name of Jesus Church, located in Chicopee, was established in 1838 (Rev. Richard F. Meehan, Springfield, MA, to E.&#160;Harden, 27 February 2002). Mary Brennan would have attended the Chicopee Church, and this may be why she wished to be buried in Chicopee.</span></p>

We know, however, that he was not Thomas Keefe, as the latter did not come to the United States until 1841. Kate McDiarmid says that the Stonington Thomas, an Irishman, worked for the Whistlers for eight years: first in Lowell, Massachusetts, going with them to Stonington, when they moved there in 1837, and to Springfield in 1840 (McDiarmid, <span class="CharOverride-1">Whistler’s Mother</span>, pp.&#160;30, 31, 32). She recorded some of Thomas’s reminiscences of the Whistler family, but, as she often did not cite her sources, we have only her tantalizing statement that these reminiscences were published in the newspapers (p. 30).</span></p>
