			<p class="Heading-2">Maxwell</p>
			<p class="Body-Text">John Stevenson Maxwell was born on 18 February 1817 in New York, the son of Agnes (Stevenson) Maxwell (5 January 1796 – New York 27 April 1866; see <a href="images_2.html#image54" target="_blank">Image 54</a>) and Hugh Maxwell (Paisley, Scotland 15 June 1787 – New York 31 March 1873; see <a href="images_2.html#image55" target="_blank">Image 55</a>) (married in New York 16 April 1812).<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-001-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-001">1</a></span></span> He was one of four surviving children, the other three being Anne Eliza (New York 1816 – New York 4 May 1888), Hugh (New York 1824 – Saddle River, NJ 23 June 1898), and Agnes (New York 1834 – New York 2 July 1917).</p>
			<p class="Body-Text">He is described in a visa granted in Hamburg on 20 July 1843 as five feet eleven inches tall, with a high forehead, light blue eyes, light brown hair, and having a “common” nose, small mouth, round chin, oval face, and fresh complexion.<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-002-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-002">2</a></span></span> For a possible image  of John Stevenson Maxwell, see <a href="appendix_j.html">Appendix J</a>.</p>
			<p class="Body-Text">Hugh Maxwell’s family emigrated to New York in 1790. He grew up there and graduated from Columbia College in 1810, with an MA in 1816, and became a very successful lawyer. He was district attorney of New York County in 1817–1818 and again from 1821 to 1829. An active member of the Whig Party, in 1849 he was appointed collector of the Port of New York by President Zachary Taylor (1794–1850; see <a href="images_2.html#image51" target="_blank">Image 51</a>), a position he held until 1853, throughout the administrations of Taylor (1849–1850) and his successor (1850–1853), Millard Fillmore (1800–1874).<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-003-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-003">3</a></span></span></p>
			<p class="Body-Text">John Stevenson Maxwell’s family lived in New York but also had a country estate, called Roslyn, at Nyack-on-Hudson. Family legend has it that “such distinguished personages from abroad as Thackeray, Victor Jacquemont, the French naturalist, and Dickens were frequently entertained” at Roslyn.<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-004-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-004">4</a></span></span></p>
			<p class="Body-Text">Maxwell attended The Lawrenceville School<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-005-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-005">5</a></span></span> and graduated from Princeton University in the Class of 1836.<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-006-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-006">6</a></span></span> He considered himself a Whig.<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-007-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-007">7</a></span></span> He “pursued the whole term of his professional studies” in law in New York in the office of Elijah Paine (1796–1853).<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-008-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-008">8</a></span></span> He was a colonel in the militia.<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-009-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-009">9</a></span></span></p>
			<p class="Body-Text">He was secretary of the American Legation in St.&#160;Petersburg from July 1842 to November 1844. He lived throughout his tour of duty in the house of Count Aleksei Alekseevich Bobrinskii on the corner of Galernaia Street and the New Admiralty Canal (see <a href="images_5.html#image86" target="_blank">Images 86–94</a>). When Colonel Charles S. Todd (see <a href="images_11.html#image278" target="_blank">Image 278</a>) chose to move the Legation from the Bobrinskii house to Tsarskoe Selo in April 1843, Maxwell and Major Whistler (see <a href="images_1.html#image7" target="_blank">Images 7–8, <a href="images_1.html#image21" target="_blank">21</a>) remained in the Bobrinskii house, and, when Major Whistler rented the entire house for his family, Maxwell remained as their tenant. His letters to his mother reveal his respect and deep love for both Major and Anna Whistler (see <a href="images_1.html#image1" target="_blank">Images 1–5</a>). </p>
			<p class="Body-Text">While living with them, he became dangerously ill with typhus fever. His life was saved chiefly through the ministrations of Anna Whistler. He became interested in Deborah Whistler (see <a href="images_1.html#image17" target="_blank">Images 17–19, <a href="images_1.html#image21" target="_blank">21</a>), although knowing that Major Whistler would only relinquish his daughter easily and gladly to an officer of the United States Army. He wrote both coy and serious letters to his family about his interest in her, but nothing came of it.</p>
			<p class="Body-Text">Maxwell was intelligent, well-educated, well-traveled, informed, cultivated, lively, witty, discerning, gossipy, at times somewhat of a popinjay, and wrote well, providing outstanding and sometimes offensive descriptions of persons, scenes, and events. While in Russia, he wrote frequent, long, loquacious, detailed letters home, chiefly to his mother, but also to his father; his uncle, Dr. John Stevenson; and a few friends. His intention was to have them published later by <span class="CharOverride-1">Harper’s</span>. He was persuaded instead to write a book based on them. In 1848, <span class="CharOverride-1">The Czar, His Court and People: Including a Tour in Norway and Sweden</span> appeared and was well received. He sent a copy to Major Whistler with a great display of modesty.<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-010-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-010">10</a></span></span> Deborah (Whistler) Haden also read it and considered parts of it to be in bad taste, having known or known of a number of the personages in it. The book is not important in a discussion of Anna Whistler’s diaries, while the detail of his letters is.</p>
			<p class="Body-Text">When Maxwell left Russia, he traveled for some eighteen months in Western Europe and the Mediterranean. During his travels and after his return to America, he corresponded with Major Whistler. He took on the task of seeing that the body of John Bouttatz Whistler was given proper burial in Stonington, Connecticut, in 1847, according to the wishes of Anna and Major Whistler. </p>
			<p class="Body-Text">Maxwell met Anna Whistler and the boys at the dock in Jersey City in August 1849, when they returned to America after Major Whistler’s death.<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-011-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-011">11</a></span></span> Anna Whistler referred to him in a letter to James as an appropriate role model for her son.<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-012-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-012">12</a></span></span> Gradually his name ceased to appear in her extant correspondence. There is also some question as to whether she ever met his parents, who both verbally and through the gift of a dress and candy thanked her after she had nursed their son back to health. Maxwell had also proposed while still in Russia that his mother attempt to make the acquaintance of Martha (Kingsley) McNeill (see <a href="images_1.html#image22" target="_blank">Image 22</a>), Anna Whistler’s mother. Scholarship places stress, rather, on a relationship between Anna Whistler and an Anne (Young) Maxwell (Coldstream, Berwick 1784 – Nyack, NY, 20 October 1867), who was possibly related to Maxwell’s father. Anne (Young) Maxwell had known Eliza and Alicia McNeill when they were growing up in Berwick. It is with her that Anna Whistler took the waters at Richfield Springs, New York, in 1857.<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-013-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-013">13</a></span></span></p>
			<p class="Body-Text">In 1846, Maxwell “had an office in the Mortimer Building, 11 Wall Street.”<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-014-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-014">14</a></span></span> In 1846, like his father and male members of his mother’s side of the family before him, he became a member (no. 1156) of the philanthropic St. Andrew’s Society of the State of New York.<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-015-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-015">15</a></span></span></p>
			<p class="Body-Text">In 1848 or 1849, he decided to request consideration for the post of United States minister resident in the Ottoman Empire and was very favorably endorsed by his former superior, Colonel Charles S. Todd, who praised the “vigorous mind and … cultivated taste” of his “inestimable friend.”<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-016-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-016">16</a></span></span> Other supporting letters were written by referees such as Elijah Paine, in whose office Maxwell had pursued his training as a lawyer.<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-017-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-017">17</a></span></span> John S. Hamilton, whom it has not been possible to identify, wrote in his letter of reference that Maxwell wanted to be accredited to Constantinople because “having been there, &amp; his mind having been earnestly directed to the situation of the Ottoman Empire, he proposed to use the facility of access to authentic sources of information in preparing a work on this subject.”<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-018-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-018">18</a></span></span> W. Pinckney Starke (d. 12 October 1886), with whom Maxwell had traveled in the East and spent several months in Paris, wrote from Charleston, South Carolina, in favor of his appointment, saying: “Though a Northern Man he is as sound on the question of Southern rights as any man living.”<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-019-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-019">19</a></span></span> The appointment, however, was given to George Perkins Marsh (1801–1882), a highly qualified career diplomat.<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-020-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-020">20</a></span></span> In 1850, Maxwell became “Cashier in the Custom House” in New York.<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-021-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-021">21</a></span></span></p>
			<p class="Body-Text">On 11 June 1853, Maxwell married Caroline Ely Mulligan (May 1823 – Brooklyn 10 November 1889), daughter of the Rev. John Mulligan (d. April 1861), in New York in the Presbyterian Church at the corner of Fifth Avenue and Nineteenth Street.<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-022-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-022">22</a></span></span> They had one daughter: Caroline Ross Maxwell (New Jersey 2 July 1853 – New York 19 May 1936).<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-023-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-023">23</a></span></span> In 1874, she married William Conselyea Traphagen (Jersey City, NJ 30 November 1837 – 1894), “son of Sarah (Conselyea) and Henry Mackaness Traphagen, President of the Fifth Ward Savings Bank of New Jersey.”<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-024-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-024">24</a></span></span></p>
			<p class="Body-Text">John Stevenson Maxwell died at Nyack, New York, on 2 March 1870.<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-025-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-025">25</a></span></span></p>
			<p class="Body-Text">The Traphagens’ daughter, Ethel Traphagen (1882–1963) (whose married name was Leigh), founded the Traphagen School of Fashion (1923) in New York.<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-026-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-026">26</a></span></span> Ethel Traphagen had “won first prize in <span class="CharOverride-1">The New York Times</span> contest for Original American Designs in 1913.” She designed a “blue-green gown with gold accents and modified obi, recalling elements of the ancient Grecian toga and stola and the kimono of the beautiful women of the ukiyo-e. The inspiration for her design was a painting by an artist she admired, James McNeill Whistler … <span class="CharOverride-1">Nocturne in Blue and Gold: Old Battersea Bridge</span>” (see <a href="images_8.html#image211" target="_blank">Images 211–212</a>).<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-027-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-027">27</a></span></span></p>
			<p class="Body-Text">Of Maxwell’s siblings, the most interesting was his younger sister, Agnes, who is mentioned as a child eight to ten years old in his letters to his mother from St.&#160;Petersburg. In 1853, in Paris, Agnes met and mutually fell in love with Major Philip Kearny (New York 1 June 1815 – Chantilly, VA 1 September 1862) of the United States Army. A married man, he was unable to obtain a divorce from his Catholic wife, and Agnes Maxwell chose to live with him openly. They had three children: Susan Watts Kearny (b. Paris 1856), Archibald Kennedy Kearny (25 January 1860 – 21 February 1862), and Virginia De Lancey Kearny (b. November 1860). In early 1858, Philip Kearny’s wife finally agreed to a divorce. Agnes Maxwell and Major Philip Kearny were married on 21 April 1858 at St. Matthew’s Church in Jersey City, New Jersey.<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-028-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-028">28</a></span></span> Kearny died in 1862 on active duty during the Civil War. Agnes (Maxwell) Kearny married, as her second husband, Admiral John Henry Upshur (Northampton County, VA 5 December 1823 – Washington, DC 30 May 1917). Agnes (Maxwell) (Kearny) Upshur and both her husbands were buried in Arlington National Cemetery.<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-029-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-029">29</a></span></span></p>
