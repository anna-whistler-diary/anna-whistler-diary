			<p class="Body-Text">Walter Stevenson (bap. Edinburgh 8 September 1788 – London 10 May 1860),<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-001-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-001">1</a></span></span> was the son of George and Elizabeth (Sharp) Stevenson. He joined the Bank of Scotland in Edinburgh in 1803 and by 1807 was third teller at the Head Office with an annual salary of £120. On 29 May 1807, Walter Stevenson married in Edinburgh<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-002-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-002">2</a></span></span> Frances Morton (bap. Edinburgh 27 April 1783 – London 16 October 1845).<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-003-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-003">3</a></span></span> Frances (Morton) Stevenson was the daughter of Walter and Rebecca (Finlay) Morton.<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-004-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-004">4</a></span></span> The Stevensons had at least five children, all born in Scotland: Rebecca (bap. Edinburgh, St. Cuthberts 16 March 1810), Walter Morton (bap. Edinburgh St. Cuthberts 17 December 1812), George (b. c. 1816), Eliza Isabella Wellwood (Edinburgh c. 1821<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-005-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-005">5</a></span></span> – London 11 February 1889),<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-006-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-006">6</a></span></span> and Francis (c. 1828 – 1 February 1902).<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-007-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-007">7</a></span></span> The Stevensons were evidently friends of the recently widowed (1820) Eliza Isabella (McNeill) Wellwood (the future Mrs. John Winstanley; see <a href="images_1.html#image40" target="_blank">Image 40</a>), as their daughter, Eliza Isabella Wellwood Stevenson, was her namesake.</p>
			<p class="Body-Text">Walter Stevenson continued to work his way up at the Bank of Scotland and on 20 August 1837 was appointed chief teller at an annual salary of £350.<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-008-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-008">8</a></span></span> On 22 January 1840, his career there ended. A Minute of the Board of Directors of the Bank of Scotland for that date announces: “Declaration of Walter Stevenson teller in the Bank’s Head Office being read, in which he admits the deficiency in the cash under his charge to a large amount. The Directors dismiss Mr. Stevenson from his situation as teller.”<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-009-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-009">9</a></span></span> Probably thirty-seven years of service and extenuating circumstances saved him from being charged with fraud. The 1841 Census shows the Stevenson family already living in London, at 3 Ferdinand Terrace, St. Pancras, except for Rebecca and Walter Morton, who may have chosen to remain in Scotland.<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-010-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-010">10</a></span></span> Walter Stevenson was described as a person of “Independent Means,” George as a surgeon, and Francis as an apprentice.<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-011-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-011">11</a></span></span> On 24 September 1844, Eliza Isabella Wellwood Stevenson married at St. Pancras Church<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-012-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-012">12</a></span></span> Thomas Macdougall Smith (Newcastle-upon-Tyne 1 November 1816 – London 24 January 1886).<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-013-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-013">13</a></span></span> Both resided in St. Pancras Parish, and they were married by license.<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-014-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-014">14</a></span></span> The witnesses were Francis Stevenson, the bride’s brother, and Catherine Shaw, daughter of Georgina and John Shaw<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-015-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-015">15</a></span></span> (see Shaw and Wardrop in this <a href="38_shaw.html">Appendix</a> and <a href="images_18.html#image486" target="_blank">Images 486–487</a>).

Walter Stevenson died on 10 May 1860.
