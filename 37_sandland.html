			<p class="Body-Text">Betsy Hewitt Dorlin (bap. 3 July 1792<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-001-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-001">1</a></span></span> – Liverpool 9 January 1859) married John Sandland (c. 1785 – Savannah, GA 27 April 1820) in Liverpool, St. Nicholas, on 29 August 1816. While still in England, they had a son, John Dorlin Sandland (c. 1817 – Ashton le Willows 19 June 1880). The Sandlands and young John traveled to America, where a second child, Eliza Sandland (Brooklyn, New York c. 1820 – Manchester 2 November 1885)<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-002-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-002">2</a></span></span> was born. In 1819, they became acquainted in Brooklyn Heights (see <a href="images_2.html#image42" target="_blank">Image 42</a>) with Dr. Daniel McNeill, Anna Whistler’s father (see <a href="images_1.html#image23" target="_blank">Image 23</a>). They visited the McNeills at “their country residence at Jamaica, Long Island,” where the teen-aged Anna McNeill (see <a href="images_1.html#image1" target="_blank">Images 1–5</a>) took the “toddling child” for walks in “the green fields.”<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-003-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-003">3</a></span></span> John Sandland was a commission merchant. Announcements in various issues of the local Savannah, Georgia, newspaper from 1818 until his death show his arrivals there as well as the arrival of cargo for him (whiskey, flour, and sundries). They also indicate that he sold bills of exchange and post notes.<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-004-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-004">4</a></span></span> During one such trip to Savannah, John Sandland died of spasms in Washington Hall on 27 or 28 April 1820, at the age of thirty-five.<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-005-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-005">5</a></span></span> His family returned to Liverpool.<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-006-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-006">6</a></span></span> When Lt. George Washington Whistler (see <a href="images_1.html#image7" target="_blank">Images 7–8, <a href="images_1.html#image21" target="_blank">21</a>) was sent to England in 1828 by the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad along with Ross Winans (see <a href="images_9.html#image228" target="_blank">Image 228</a>) and William Gibbs McNeill (see <a href="images_1.html#image31" target="_blank">Image 31</a>), they took young John Dorlin Sandland, then a schoolboy, to breakfast at the Waterloo Hotel in Liverpool.<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-007-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-007">7</a></span></span> In the fall of 1829, when Anna McNeill reached Liverpool for an extended visit with the Winstanleys in Preston, she went to stay at the home of Mrs. Sandland until Alicia McNeill (see <a href="images_1.html#image39" target="_blank">Image 39</a>) could come to Liverpool to get her.<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-008-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-008">8</a></span></span> In 1843, now married and a mother, she visited the Sandlands again, on her way to Russia, and continued to do so each time she came from Russia to England, except in 1848. During her 1843 visit, John Dorlin Sandland was absent. On Sunday, 2 August 1840, he had left England, not intending “to return for years” (an affair of the heart seems to have been the cause) and spent “more than four years” in the Brazils.<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-009-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-009">9</a></span></span> It eventually became necessary for him to take a sea voyage for his health, so he set out from where he had been living in the Brazils for Para, arriving there in early March 1842.<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-010-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-010">10</a></span></span> In 1845, he published a volume entitled <span class="CharOverride-1">The Wanderer and Other Poems</span>, which he had written during that four-year sojourn in South America.<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-011-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-011">11</a></span></span> The preface to the volume was written in Blakeney, Gloucestershire, in August 1845.<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-012-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-012">12</a></span></span> In the notes, John Dorlin Sandland explained that he had “a Prose Work, now in hand, upon the Brazils and the Brazilians,” in which he intended to write on the subject of slavery, having lived in a “slave-owning community.”<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-013-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-013">13</a></span></span> He seemed to have problems finding employment.<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-014-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-014">14</a></span></span> In 1847, Anna Whistler was in Preston again and visited the Sandlands in Liverpool. She was met at Edge Hill Station (which is on the main railroad line out of Liverpool; see <a href="images_3.html#image61" target="_blank">Image 61</a>) by Eliza and John Dorlin Sandland. She went with them to their home at 10 Cambridge Street and saw their mother, Betsy Hewitt (Dorlin) Sandland, who was in mourning for her nephew and niece, John Dorlin Grayson (bap. Liverpool, St. Peter, 31 March 1807 – Roby 1 September 1847) and his sister, Elizabeth (Bessie) Grayson (bap. Liverpool, St. Peter, 26 April 1821 – Roby 8 September 1847), who had died at Roby within a week of one another, of unrelated illnesses.<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-015-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-015">15</a></span></span> They were the children of Charles Grayson and Betsy H.D. Sandland’s sister, Hannah (Dorlin) Grayson. In 1849, after the death of Major Whistler, Anna Whistler and Willie (see <a href="images_1.html#image27" target="_blank">Images 27</a>, <a href="images_1.html#image30" target="_blank">30</a>) stopped in England on their way home to the United States and visited the Sandlands again. Betsy H.D. Sandland died on 9 January 1859. The witnesses to her last will and testament were Eliza (see <a href="images_1.html#image40" target="_blank">Image 40</a>) and John Winstanley. In June 1874, John Dorlin Sandland wrote a letter to the <span class="CharOverride-1">Pall Mall Gazette</span> in response to an article reviewing an exhibit of James Whistler’s paintings and drawings that had appeared in its June 13 issue.<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-016-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-016">16</a></span></span> In his response, he spoke of how he had come to know the McNeill family, of Major Whistler, and of James Whistler (see <a href="images_1.html#image24" target="_blank">Images 24–29</a>) as an artist whose genius had now been recognized by the public.<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-017-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-017">17</a></span></span> As a source for his own personal biography, the article makes clear only that he still made Liverpool his home. He said in it, too, that he had received from James Whistler photographs of paintings by James, executed when, after his Paris years of study, he had taken a trip around the world “with a party of friends in a yacht.”<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-018-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-018">18</a></span></span> John Dorlin Sandland worked as a bookkeeper. He never married. He died intestate in Ashton le Willows, Lancashire, on 19 June 1880. Eliza Sandland married Thomas Boyd the Younger (c. 1821 – Stockport Etchells, Cheshire 28 April 1874), iron merchant, on 21 June 1849 in Liverpool, St. Bride’s.<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-019-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-019">19</a></span></span> They had five surviving children: Thomas Albert (Windsor, Liverpool 9 November 1853 – Antigua, West Indies 1 December 1879), John Sandland (bap. Windsor, Liverpool 10 June 1855 – Salford District, June Qtr. 1873), James Charles (bap. Windsor, Liverpool 31 May 1857 – Salford District, June Qtr. 1890), Eliza Mary (bap. Windsor, Liverpool 9 October 1859 – Ryde, IOW, 10 September 1936), and George Herbert (bap. Salford 1 March 1863 – Broadstairs, Kent 26 March 1932).<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-020-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-020">20</a></span></span> Anna Whistler referred in her correspondence to the poverty in which the Boyds were living in the 1870s.<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-021-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-021">21</a></span></span></p>

J.D.S. says his father died on 27 April 1820; the Register says his death occurred on 28 April 1820. Presumably he was buried in Savannah. “The primary cemetery in Savannah from the mid 18th century until 1853 was the Colonial Cemetery, and unless Mr. Sandland was buried in a private cemetery that is almost certainly where he was interred … there is no complete list of burials for Colonial Cemetery” (Jan Flores, archivist, Georgia Historical Society Library to E.&#160;Harden, n.d.).</span></p>
