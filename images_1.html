				<p class="Body-Text-Image">Most of the images contained herein are in the public domain. For those which are not, every effort has been made to identify and receive permission from copyright holders. Some images, while in the public domain, have been reproduced from published works; these have been identified in the bibliographic details that follow the image captions. </p>
				<p class="Body-Text-Image">Images have been chosen on the following basis: persons, places, events, and objects actually recorded in the diaries as having been met, visited, attended, owned, or seen by Anna Whistler; recorded in the diary of a journey made to Edinburgh by Anna Whistler’s half-sister, Eliza Winstanley (see <a href="appendix_d.html">Appendix D</a>); referred to in the introductory material; and referred to in the biographies of friends, family, and aquaintances contained in <a href="appendix_e.html">Appendix E</a>.  </p>
				<p class="Body-Text-Image">Every effort has been made to locate images of individuals presented in this volume, but I was unable to find images of a number of Anna Whistler’s aquaintances that I would have liked to include, for example John Stevenson Maxwell.<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-001-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-001">1</a></span></span> At times, the images are of poorer quality than I would have liked, but I have chosen to include them nonetheless, as they are often the only known – or the best available – image of these individuals.</p>
				<p class="Body-Text-Image">In selecting images, research was focused firstly on images of the 1840s, secondly on images of the 1830s and 1850s, and then for images beyond the 1850s. My preference was first for photographs; then for artists’ original depictions held by museums; then for illustrations of artists’ works recorded in printed sources. Dates for images are recorded in the bibliographic details below each image.</p>
				<p class="Body-Text-Image">The images presented are grouped according to the following categories: Anna McNeill Whistler’s extended family; the Whistlers’ lives in the United States; images associated with Eliza Winstanley’s diary, which Anna Whistler read; Anna Whistler’s journey to St.&#160;Petersburg with her family in 1843; the city of St.&#160;Petersburg, including the Bobrinskii House, in which the Whistlers lived, and the Imperial Academy of Fine Arts and James Whistler’s experiences there; other artists, musicians, scientists, and literary figures; Major Whistler’s work colleagues on the St.&#160;Petersburg–Moscow Railway and at the Alexandrofsky Head Mechanical Works; friends and associates of the Whistlers in St.&#160;Petersburg; other significant persons and personages – many of them St. Petersburg residents who were part of the Whistlers’ world – including members of the military, diplomats, nobility, and other foreign visitors to St. Petersburg, such as dentist Dr. Edward Maynard, who fixed Whistler family members’ teeth; daily Russian life, ranging from peasant games to religious festivals; the environs of St.&#160;Petersburg; the Imperial family; places and images associated with Grand Duchess Aleksandra Nikolaevna, whose death had a strong impact on both the Russian and the foreign communities in St.&#160;Petersburg; Anna Whistler and her children’s trip to Germany and England in the summer of 1847, which culminated in Debo’s wedding; and Anna Whistler and her children’s trip to Copenhagen, England, and the Isle of Wight in the summer of 1848.</p>
				<p class="Body-Text-Image">By including these images, I hope to further increase my readers’ understanding of St. Petersburg in the 1840s, in which Anna Whistler lived and wrote her diaries. Once again, I wish to express my gratitude for the gracious permissions given by those who were approached as contributors.</p>

The front of the bodice is arranged in typical loose gathers radiating upward from the centre waist in a fan shape to the shoulder seams, where the fullness is gathered again by several rows of shirred stitching. The modest colour of her dress is appropriate to the taste of the period and is complemented by the soft white linen or cotton collar, which was likely embroidered with small white flowers and dots and edged with narrow bobbin lace.” (Ivan Sayers, honorary curator of the BC Society for the Museum of Original Costume and curator emeritus of the Museum of Vancouver)</figcaption>
