			<p class="Body-Text">Ivan Frantsevich Buttats (Bouttatz)<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-001-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-001">1</a></span></span> (Moscow 2 June [OS] 1809 – 25 July [OS] 1876)<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-002-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-002">2</a></span></span> was the son of Frants Buttats (c. 1774 – after 1824), a medical doctor. His father was one of the first doctors engaged in large-scale smallpox vaccination in Russia.<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-003-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-003">3</a></span></span> Buttats had a brother, Aleksei Frantsevich Buttats (c. 1810 – 23 March 1846), also working for the railroads.<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-004-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-004">4</a></span></span> They were therefore often referred to in their files as Buttats 1 and Buttats 2. Ivan Frantsevich was a Russian citizen, born in Moscow. He was of the Lutheran faith, gentry class, and a bachelor.</p>
			<p class="Body-Text">He entered the Institute of the Corps of Transport Engineers on 8 February 1826. On 5 December 1827, he was made sub-ensign (2nd class), and on 19 July 1828 sub-ensign (1st class). On the basis of his performance on examinations, he was promoted to ensign on 2 July 1829. He was made second lieutenant on 19 June 1830 and lieutenant on 14 June 1831. He was made captain on 2 December 1835 and, for excellence, major on 6 December 1841.<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-005-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-005">5</a></span></span> </p>
			<p class="Body-Text">Among the projects he was engaged in were the following: on 5 March 1830, he was appointed a coach (<span class="CharOverride-1">repetitor</span>) in the Institute; on 29 July 1831, he was appointed to help build the highway from Pulkovo to the Krasnoe Selo highway; on 27 March 1833, he was sent to Sestroretsk to engage in work on the munitions factory there; in 1834, he was appointed to work on the reconstruction of the cupola of Trinity Cathedral of the Izmailov Regiment; on 4 January 1841, he helped build the Anichkov Bridge over the Fontanka River; on 22 February 1842, he was temporarily put at the disposal of the Committee for the building of the St.&#160;Petersburg–Moscow Railway.<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-006-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-006">6</a></span></span></p>
			<p class="Body-Text">Probably the most desirable and interesting assignment he received was being selected to travel to the United States to help persuade Major Whistler (see <a href="images_1.html#image7" target="_blank">Images 7–8, <a href="images_1.html#image21" target="_blank">21</a>) to accept the post of consulting engineer for the building of the St.&#160;Petersburg–Moscow Railway. He had made known to P.P. Mel’nikov (see <a href="images_9.html#image247" target="_blank">Image 247</a>), when the latter was seeking someone to accompany him to the United States in 1838, that he knew English.<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-007-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-007">7</a></span></span> Mel’nikov had said he would choose Buttats if his Institute colleague, N.O. Kraft (see <a href="images_9.html#image248" target="_blank">Image 248</a>), declined, but Kraft accepted.<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-008-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-008">8</a></span></span> Buttats’s later appointment<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-009-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-009">9</a></span></span> to the post, in 1842, gave him the opportunity to see London, where he bought geodesic instruments for the Russian government.<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-010-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-010">10</a></span></span> Accompanying Major Whistler back to Russia, he had the further opportunity to see Paris and Brussels.<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-011-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-011">11</a></span></span> </p>
			<p class="Body-Text">On his return to Russia, Buttats was appointed head of the Drafting Department of the railway and taught drafting courses in the Transport Institute.<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-012-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-012">12</a></span></span> He held the rank of lieutenant colonel as of 6 December 1843.<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-013-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-013">13</a></span></span></p>
			<p class="Body-Text">In his report of 12 December 1844 to the emperor, Count P.A. Kleinmikhel’ (see <a href="images_9.html#image243" target="_blank">Image 243</a>) said that Lt. Colonel Buttats had requested permission to retire from the service for personal reasons. As his service record met the requirements for retirement in the rank then held by him, with the right to continue wearing his uniform, Kleinmikhel’ requested this, and Nicholas I (see <a href="images_15.html#image421" target="_blank">Images 420–423</a>) approved his request on 28 December 1844 / 7 January 1845.<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-014-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-014">14</a></span></span></p>
			<p class="Body-Text">In 1845, when the last Whistler child was born and baptized John Bouttatz, Anna Whistler (see <a href="images_1.html#image1" target="_blank">Images 1–5</a>) recorded that Major Bouttatz was engaged in some mines on the border of Russia and China. With this announcement, he disappears from her diaries.<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-015-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-015">15</a></span></span></p>
			<p class="Body-Text">Buttats’s brother, Captain Aleksei Frantsevich, who was in the Construction Division of the Corps of Transport Engineers, held in 1845 the post of head of the Sixth Distance of the IVth Section of the Eleventh District of the St.&#160;Petersburg–Moscow Railway. He was married and had at least two daughters. One was named Vera, and in 1845 she was four years old. On 23 March 1846, he died, and Ivan Frantsevich took on the support of these daughters, in whole or in part, for the next thirty years.<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-016-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-016">16</a></span></span> </p>
			<p class="Body-Text">On 28 May 1874, the director of the St.&#160;Petersburg–Warsaw Railway requested that retired Engineer Lt. Colonel Buttats be confirmed head of the newly re-organized Stores Administration with compensation appropriate to his rank. Buttats was confirmed, receiving a salary of three thousand rubles per year with travel expenses of six hundred rubles.<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-017-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-017">17</a></span></span></p>
			<p class="Body-Text">Buttats died on 25 July 1876 at 2:45 p.m.,<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-018-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-018">18</a></span></span> and on 26 July 1876 a telegram was sent to the chairman of the Council of the Administration saying that the entire staff of the Stores Administration wished to be present at the carrying out of the body of Buttats on Wednesday, 28 July, and asked that while they were absent the store be closed.<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-019-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-019">19</a></span></span></p>
			<p class="Body-Text">On 2 August 1876, the director of the St.&#160;Petersburg–Warsaw Railway, writing to the Council of the Administration, explained the overwhelming circumstances of Buttats’s professional and family life. The deceased’s grave and prolonged illness was in many respects brought on by the constant and unrelenting labors he bore for the good of the Railway Society. On being confirmed in the position of head of the Stores Administration in May 1874, during the reorganization of the stores he had to assume special duties connected with introducing the new order of clerical work, given the complete lack of preparedness of his staff. These labors, together with his declining years, resulted in destructive consequences for his health. Fires in the workshops in 1876 required further increased efforts on the part of the Stores Administration, and Buttats spent whole days and nights in the store trying to avert further misfortunes. His ceaseless efforts resulted in a physical and emotional breakdown, and soon after the fires he took to his bed permanently. But he had one further moral obligation that he had taken on, when he promised his dying brother that he would assume the support and care of his brother’s daughters. Until his very death, he gave them the larger part of his relatively small salary. With his death, one niece was again reduced to no means of support. The director therefore petitioned the Council for funds to cover the deceased’s burial expenses and to maintain the niece until she could find further means of support. On 4 August 1876, the Council voted to support the director’s two requests by giving Buttats’s niece three months’ financial aid, equal to 750 rubles of his salary.<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-020-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-020">20</a></span></span> </p>
