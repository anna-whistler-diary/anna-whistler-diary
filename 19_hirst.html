Nineteenth-century Huddersfield directories from 1805 to 1817 cite them as “merchants,” “merchants and manufacturers,” “woolstaplers,” and “woollen manufacturers.”<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-008-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-008">8</a></span></span></p>

			<p class="Body-Text">“Thomas Nelson Hirst and John Wood, now or late of Huddersfield, … Merchants, Dealers, Chapmen and Partners,” were declared “bankrupts” in May 1818.<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-014-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-014">14</a></span></span> William Hirst Jr., father of Thomas Nelson Hirst, left his estate of about £3000 to his two daughters and to the children of his son, stipulating that the interest from the share of his estate going to his grandchildren when the youngest of them reaches twenty-one should, until then, be paid out in their maintenance and education.<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-015-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-015">15</a></span></span> The will also indicated that he had lent his son money and required that the grandchildren’s share of the estate be reduced by deducting from it as much money as he had paid or advanced during his lifetime to his son.</p>
			<p class="Body-Text">How soon after the death of his wife Thomas Nelson Hirst moved to St.&#160;Petersburg has not been ascertained. It had to be no later than May or June 1828, when Caroline Holliday (b. 1801), spinster, whom he married in that city on 29 October / 10 November 1828,<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-016-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-016">16</a></span></span> appears to have become pregnant. Their first child, Caroline, was born on 30 January / 11 February 1829. She died at the age of twenty-one days. A son, Henry, was born on 14/26 March 1830. He died on 15/27 July 1836. A son, Edward Radcliffe, was born on 29 June / 11 July 1833. Another daughter, Elizabeth Mary, was born on 15/27 October 1834. A second daughter named Caroline was born on 13/25 November 1835, but died at the age of sixteen months. A daughter, Maria, was born on 13/25 May 1837.<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-017-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-017">17</a></span></span> Caroline (Holliday) Hirst died on 8/20 February 1842.<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-018-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-018">18</a></span></span> On 20 November / 2 December 1842, Thomas Nelson Hirst married Margaret Gordon (c. 1809 – St.&#160;Petersburg 22 March / 3 April 1891), widow.<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-019-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-019">19</a></span></span> He died on 22 May / 3 June 1863 and was buried in the Smolensk Cemetery on 27 May / 8 June 1863 by “Wm.

			<p class="Body-Text">Nothing is known of Elizabeth Hirst.</p>
			<p class="Body-Text">Whether Mary Gent Hirst accompanied her brother to St.&#160;Petersburg or came later is not clear. She may have been from Preston, as Anna Whistler (see <a href="images_1.html#image1" target="_blank">Images 1–5</a>), on arriving in St.&#160;Petersburg, gave Margaret (Gordon) Hirst a letter for her from an unidentified correspondent in Preston.<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-022-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-022">22</a></span></span> Anna Whistler, who became friends with her and frequently visited her, says she was lame and had been bed ridden with cancer for five years when she died in 1844.<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-023-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-023">23</a></span></span></p>
			<p class="Body-Text">Thomas Nelson Hirst owned a house on Vasilievskii Island on the Fifth Line between Bol’shoi and Srednii prospects at No. 31, in which he ran a boarding school for boys. Mary Gent Hirst also lived here. Legend has it that Count Aleksei Andreevich Arakcheev (1769–1834) was born in this house (see Kleinmikhel’ in this <a href="20_kleinmikhel.html">Appendix</a> and <a href="images_9.html#image244" target="_blank">Image 244</a>). The building has been described as German, two stories high, and shaped like an upside-down L, with another separate small two-storied stone wing in the courtyard.<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-024-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-024">24</a></span></span></p>
			<p class="Body-Text">Thomas Nelson Hirst was issued a certificate (no. 762) on 28 May 1829 (OS) to establish his school. In his report for the second half of 1847 on private educational institutions in St.&#160;Petersburg under his supervision, the inspector, Court Councilor Iosif Somov, gave the following information about Hirst and his school. A British subject of the Anglican faith, Hirst had a boarding school of the first category for boys in his home. The subjects taught were the Orthodox, Lutheran, and Roman Catholic religions; Russian, English, French, German, and Latin; mathematics; practical arithmetic; bookkeeping; universal history; physics; geography; penmanship and dancing. The number of pupils, their social class and fees were: 82 boys: from the nobility and civil service, 18; clergy, 1; merchant, 57; petit bourgeoisie, 7. Boarding, 27; half-board, 14; day students, 41. Annual fees: boarding, 430 rubles; half-board, 230 rubles; day, 143 rubles. The inspector found that the fulfillment of Christian obligations was observed. Cleanliness, neatness, and discipline were extremely well observed, and the maintenance of the pupils, including sufficient school equipment, corresponded to the fees they paid. The inspector added a note saying that “the institution merits full praise just as it has in the past.”<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-025-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-025">25</a></span></span></p>
			<p class="Body-Text">Joseph Harrison Jr. (see <a href="images_9.html#image226" target="_blank">Image 226</a>) sent his son, William Henry, called Henry, to this school. Henry liked it “much better than he did Jourdans,”<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-026-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-026">26</a></span></span> but a year later his father wrote Anna Whistler, without clarifying, that they were “at present … not at all satisfied in sending Henry to Hirsts school.”<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-027-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-027">27</a></span></span> This may not, however, have implied a negative assessment of the school but of Henry, who was eventually confined to a mental institution.<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-028-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-028">28</a></span></span></p>
			<p class="Body-Text">After the death of Thomas Nelson Hirst, his son, called Dmitrii Fomich Girst by the Russians, became the owner of the house and director of the boarding school. Petr Ivanovich Shchukin (1853–1912), who became a wealthy merchant and one of the great art patrons of Russia, attended the Hirst boarding school from 1867 to 1871 and seemed to like it. He left interesting memoirs of his teachers and fellow students.<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-029-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-029">29</a></span></span> In 1876, Dmitrii Hirst sold the house and school for forty thousand rubles to a man named Humbert, who in 1881 closed the school permanently.<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-030-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-030">30</a></span></span> In 1884, a man named Bremer built an enormous house in its place.<span class="CharOverride-2"><span id="endnote-031-backlink"><a class="_idEndnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-031">31</a></span></span></p>

			<p class="Endnote-text"><span id="endnote-011"><a class="_idEndnoteAnchor _idGenColorInherit" href="#endnote-011-backlink">11</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;Tracy (as he called himself) Turnerelli was the fifth child and only son of Peter and Margaret (Tracy) Turnerelli, and the only child still alive at the time of his father’s second marriage in late (December) 1835 (Edward Tracy Turnerelli, <span class="CharOverride-1">Memories of a Life of Toil: The Autobiography of Tracy Turnerelli “The Old Conservative.” A Record of Work Artistic, Literary, and Political, from 1835 to 1884</span> (London: Field &#38; Tuer; Leadenhall Press; E.D. Simpkin, Marshall; Hamilton, Adams, 1884), p.&#160;35). As this “marriage … rendered home less happy than before” (Turnerelli, <span class="CharOverride-1">Memories</span>, p.&#160;38), he decided to visit Russia, using the written invitation Emperor Alexander I had given to his father while in England in 1814. Peter Turnerelli had never taken advantage of the invitation and, at his son’s request, gave it to him (Turnerelli, p.&#160;38). But instead of “practising his profession as a sculptor” (Turnerelli, p.&#160;42), Tracy Turnerelli undertook to draw “the Ancient Monuments of the Russian Empire,” titling himself their “Delineator” (Turnerelli, pp.&#160;44, 66).</span></p>
			<p class="Endnote-text2">Although he actually spent eighteen years in Russia, starting for that country “in the beginning of June, 1836” (Turnerelli, p.&#160;40) and setting out for England in August 1854 (Turnerelli, p.&#160;72), he himself called it a sojourn of sixteen years, counting only the time he actually spent in his “rambles” <span class="CharOverride-1">outside</span> St.&#160;Petersburg, i.e., from sometime after mid-June 1837 (Turnerelli, pp.&#160;48–49) until June 1853 (Turnerelli, p.&#160;63). The title page of his earlier brief memoirs of Nicholas I, his patron, and of the Imperial family also clearly states that he spent sixteen years in Russia (<span class="CharOverride-1">What I Know of the Late Emperor Nicholas and His Family</span> by Edward Tracy Turnerelli. Sixteen Years Resident in Russia. Author of <span class="CharOverride-1">Kazan, The Ancient Capital of the Tartar Khans</span>, etc. etc. Second Edition. London: Edward Churton, 1855). See also <span class="CharOverride-1">The Times</span> (London), January 25, 1896, p.&#160;6.</p>
			<p class="Endnote-text2">There is nothing in the autobiography to suggest that he had any contact with his brother-in-law, Thomas Nelson Hirst, while in Russia. As Hirst was widowed in 1822, when Turnerelli was eight years old, and had gone to Russia some time in the 1820s, it is not likely that they maintained a relationship over the years. But, as Turnerelli attracted much attention and became a well-known eccentric Englishman by sitting out in the open in St.&#160;Petersburg and drawing the city’s landmarks, it would seem that news of his presence could have reached Hirst’s ears (Turnerelli, <span class="CharOverride-1">Memories</span>, pp.&#160;44–46). In any case, Hirst’s marriage into so prominent and wealthy a family has a certain mystery about it.</p>
